This goal can be accomplished by having a thorough understanding of which activities and costs support an organization's strategic position and which activities and costs either weaken it or have no impact. Subsequent cost management efforts can then focus on reducing or limiting expenditures on activities that add little or no strategic value, while increasing expenditures on activities that support the strategic position of the organization. Performance can then be evaluated to ensure that the chosen actions are taken, and that these actions are yielding improved strategic performance. Throughout the course, a strategic cost analysis and management framework will be applied across functions and organizations to highlight the cost analysis and performance evaluation methods available to forecast financial performance and improve strategic position.",Varies by section,"Students with a semester level of Freshman may not enroll.

Introduction to Africana Studies,AFRC 1001,Lecture,In Class,1,"The term Africana emerged in public discourse amid the social, political, and cultural turbulence of the 1960s. The roots of the field, however, are much older,easily reaching back to oral histories and writings during the early days of the Trans-Atlantic African slave trade. The underpinnings of the field continued to grow in the works of enslaved Africans, abolitionists and social critics of the nineteenth century, and evolved in the twentieth century by black writers, journalists, activists, and educators as the sought to document African descended people's lives. Collectively, their work established African Studies as a discipline,epistemological standpoint and political practice dedicated to understanding the multiple trajectories and experiences of black people in the world throughout history. As an ever-transforming field of study, this course will examine the genealogy, major discourses, and future trajectory of Africana Studies. Using primary sources such as maps and letters, as well as literature and performance, our study of Africana will begin with continental Africa, move across the Atlantic during the middle passage and travel from the coasts of Bahia in the 18th century to the streets of Baltimore in the 21st century. The course is constructed around major themes in Black intellectual thought including: retentions and transferal, diaspora, black power, meanings of blackness, uplift and nationalism. While attending to narratives and theories that concern African descended people in the United States, the course is uniquely designed with a focus on gender and provides context for the African diasporic experience in the Caribbean and Latin America.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

History of American Law to 1877,AFRC 1119,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course is designed to explore major themes and events in early American legal history. Because of the richness of the subject matter and the wealth of sources available, we will be selective in our focus. The course will emphasize several core areas of legal development that run throughout colonial and early national history: 1) the state: including topics such as war and other military or police action, insurrection, revolution, regulation, courts, economic policy, and public health; 2) labor: including race and racially-based slavery, varied forms of servitude and labor coercion, household labor, industrialization, unionization, and market development; 3) property: including property in persons, land, and business, and the role of lawyers in promoting the creation of wealth; 4) private spaces: including family, individual rights, sexuality, gender, and private relations of authority; 5) constitutionalism: various methods of setting norms (rules, principles, values) that create, structure, and define the limits of government power and authority in colonial/imperial, state, and national contexts; 6) democracy and belonging: including questions of citizenship, voting rights, and participation in public life. By placing primary sources within historical context, the course will expose students to the ways that legal change has affected the course of American history and contemporary life. The course will be conducted primarily in lecture format, but I invite student questions and participation. In the end, the central aim of this course is to acquaint students with a keen sense of the ways that law has operated to liberate, constrain, and organize Americans.

It is one component of a pilot project supported by Penn Global and directed by the instructor on ‘Local Histories of Climate Change in the Horn of Africa”, though we will cover topics and case studies from the entire continent. The course takes an historical perspective on environmental change in Africa, with an eye to engaging current debates on climate change and its impact on contemporary urban and rural communities. Students will read and discuss key works on the African environment, conduct their own literature reviews on selected topics, and prepare case studies of communities which have been impacted by severe climate events in the past half-century.

"History of Brazil: Slavery, Inequality, Development",AFRC 1475,Lecture,In Class,1,"In the past decade, Brazil has emerged a leading global power. As the world's fifth-largest country, by size and population, and the ninth-largest by GDP, Brazil exerts tremendous influence on international politics and the global economy, seen in its position as an emerging BRIC nation and a regional heavyweight in South America. Brazil is often in the news for its strides in social welfare, leading investments in the Global South, as host of the World Cup and Olympics, and, most recently, for its political instability. It is also a nation of deep contradictions, in which myth of racial democracy -- the longstanding creed that Brazilian society has escaped racial discrimination -- functions alongside pervasive social inequality, state violence, political corruption, and an unforgiving penal system. This course examines six centuries of Brazilian history. It highlights the interplay between global events -- colonialism, slavery and emancipation, capitalism, and democratization -- and the local geographies, popular cultures, and social movements that have shaped this multi-ethnic and expansive nation. In particular, the readings will highlight Brazil's place in Latin America and the Lusophone World, as well as the ways in which Brazil stands as a counterpoint to the United States, especially in terms of the legacy of slavery and race relation. In this lecture, we will also follow the current political and economic crises unfolding in Brazil, at a moment when it has become all the more important to evaluate just how South America's largest nation has shaped and been shaped by global events.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of ""World Music"" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.

Using African diaspora, critical dance, performance, and black feminist frameworks, we will examine the history, politics, and aesthetics of ""black dance"". Through a keywords format, we'll construct both a vocabulary: a body of words used to describe a phenomena, and a grammar: a body of rules that lay bare the operations between terms.

Our key terms will allow us to examine a number of dancers, choreographers, companies, and movement practices.

Du Bois In Black Reconstruction in America, Du Bois writes: “What was slavery in the United States? Just what did it mean to the owner and the owned?” But these are trick questions in a work of history that dwells in the moment of slavery’s endtime to consider the failure of emancipation and reconstruction to materialize black freedom. The questions become, What was jubilee? Just what did it mean? Did slavery end? This course examines Du Bois’ six decade struggle to come to terms, in language, with the receding promise of emancipation (which he called the “negro apocalypse”). We trace the poetics of heartbreak in John Brown, The Souls of Black Folk, Black Reconstruction in America (selections), Dusk of Dawn, Dark Princess and other writings.

Where peace could not be maintained violence erupted. Even where secession has been attained, as in the new country of South Sudan, the threat of civil war lingers. While domestic politics have led to the rise of armed conflicts and civil wars in many African countries, the external factors should also not be ignored. Important in all current conflicts is the concern to international peace and security. Overall this course will: (1) investigate the general nature of armed conflicts in Africa (2) provide in-depth analysis of the underlying factors (3) and discuss the regional and the international responses to these conflicts and their implications.

August Wilson and Beyond,AFRC 2325,Seminar,In Class,1,"""The people need to know the story. See how they fit into it. See what part they play.” - August Wilson, King Hedley II If you want to get to know community members from West Philadelphia, collaborate deeply with classmates, gain deeper and more nuanced understandings of African American history and culture, engage in a wide range of learning methods, and explore some of the most treasured plays in the American theatre, then this is the course for you. No previous experience required, just curiosity and willingness to engage. In this intergenerational seminar, Penn students together with older community members read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traditions, traumas, and triumphs through the decades, nearly all told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. (Two of Wilson’s plays are receiving fresh attention with recent acclaimed film versions: Fences with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis; Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom with Davis and Chadwick Boseman.) Class participants develop relationships with one other while exploring the history and culture that shaped these powerful plays. As an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, the class plans and hosts events for a multigenerational, West Philadelphia-focused audience with community partners West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance / Paul Robeson House & Museum, and Theatre in the X. Class members come to a deeper understanding of Black life in Philadelphia through stories community members share in oral history interviews. These stories form the basis for an original performance the class creates, presented at an end-of-semester gathering. Wilson's plays provide the bridge between class members from various generations and backgrounds. The group embodies collaborative service through the art and connection-building conversations it offers to the community.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

Each week or so, we will examine a different social group and its treatment by historians, as well as anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists, and novelists. Along the way, we will pay special attention to the question of sources: how can we recover the perspectives of people who rarely left their own accounts? How can we use documents and material objects—many of which were produced by colonial officials and elites—to access the experiences of the indigenous, the enslaved, and the poor? We will have some help approaching these questions from the knowledgeable staff at the Penn Museum, the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, and the Van Pelt Library.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in World History (AHCW)

Africana Sacred Communities in the U.S.,AFRC 4052,Seminar,In Class,1,"This undergraduate seminar places contemporary Black spiritualities at the center of the study of African-descended peoples. Through recent books in the ethnography of Africana religions, spiritual communities in Africa, the Caribbean, and North America that have established communities in the United States will constitute the focus of our course readings and anchor our weekly discussions. As an advanced seminar, our meetings will allow participants to interrogate the authors of these ethnographies. We will assess how these accounts have conceptualized the African diaspora and the vantages (“insiders” and “outsiders”) from which they describe religious beliefs, practices, and institutions. Beyond considering the commonalities and distinctions in form and practice that characterize various African diasporic religious practices, participants will also work to understand the constructions of race and belonging, ethnic identity, gender, sexuality, class, and geographic location that affect the lives of Black religious adherents.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

We explore how values are placed on resources, how such values, the regimes of valuation, commodification and the social formations that are (re)produced by these regimes lead to cooperation and conflict in the contemporary African state, including in the relationships of resource-rich African countries with global powers.

Critical Ethnography,AFRC 5500,Seminar,In Class,1,"""This graduate course introduces students to theories, practices, and critiques of critical ethnography. Ethnography -- an approach to the study of culture which anthropologist James Clifford described as a process that ""translates experiences into text"" - will have our full attention. This process of translation, although seemingly straightforward, requires layers of interpretation, selection, and the imposition of a viewpoint or politics. While ethnography is often narrowly conceived of as a methodology, this course considers ethnography as a mode of inquiry, as a philosophy, as an ongoing question and performance. We wrestle with notions of ""the self"" and ""the other"" at the intersection of imbricated cultural and performance worlds. Together we'll ask: How is ethnography both critical and performative? What is the relationship between theory and method? How can we evaluate ethnographic work? And finally, what kinds of ethnographers do we want to be? This course considers a range of ethnographic examples in order to analyze both the craft and the stakes of ""translating experiences into text.""",Not available,Not available,ANTH Cultural and Linguistics (AACL),T 12pm-2:59pm (8/27 to 12/9),Jasmine Johnson,,,,,ANTH 5500,,,[1.0]

"Stereotype Threat, Impostor Phenomenon, and African Americans",AFRC 6020,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course critically examines stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon as they relate to African Americans. Both stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon negatively affect African Americans. The apprehension experienced by African Americans that they might behave in a manner that confirms an existing negative cultural stereotype is stereotype threat, which usually results in reduced effectiveness in African Americans' performance. Stereotype threat is linked with impostor phenomenon. Impostor phenomenon is an internal experience of intellectual phoniness in authentically talented individuals, in which they doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud. While stereotype threat relies on broad generalization, the impostor phenomenon describes feelings of personal inadequacy, especially in high-achieving African Americans. This course will explore the evolving meanings connected to both stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon in relation to African Americans.",Not available,Not available,"GSE Division- Human Development & Quant Methods (GVHQ)

Black Political Thought: Difference And Community,AFRC 6550,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course is designed to familiarize graduate students with some of the key texts and debates in Africana Studies concerning the relationship between racial slavery, modernity and politics. Beginning with the Haitian Revolution, much of black political thought (thinking and doing politics) has advocated group solidarity and cohesion in the face of often overwhelming conditions of servitude, enslavement and coercion within the political economy of slavery and the moral economy of white supremacy. Ideas and practices of freedom however, articulated by political actors and intellectuals alike, have been as varied as the routes to freedom itself. Thus, ideas and practices of liberty, citizenship and political community within many African and Afro-descendant communities have revealed multiple, often competing forms of political imagination. The multiple and varied forms of political imagination, represented in the writings of thinkers like Eric Williams, Richard Wright, Carole Boyce Davies and others, complicates any understanding of black political thought as having a single origin, genealogy or objective. Students will engage these and other authors in an effort to track black political thought's consonance and dissonance with Western feminisms, Marxism, nationalism and related phenomena and ideologies of the 20th and now 21st century.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

"Considering Race, Class and Punishment in the American Prison System",AFRC 9017,Seminar,In Class,1,"This writing seminar will sharpen and expand our writing, while bringing to our hearts and minds a deeper understanding of the reality of imprisonment in the United States. This system never goes away. This year it is locking up more than 2,300,000 men, women and children—the highest per-capita rate of imprisonment in the world. Even when we know the statistics and watch shows about crime and jail on TV, what do we really know about life behind bars? For a year? Ten years? Life? As a young journalist, I saw how the criminal justice system was used to suppress Black leadership. I felt drawn to teach creative writing at Holmesburg Prison, to eventually investigate the state prison system, interview prisoners, make friendships, write a newspaper series, magazine articles, and my first book on the subject. For nearly five decades, I’ve observed the human cost of a prison system that connects and damages all of our lives and keeps people from poverty in place. In this course, we will seek insights in books and stories written from prisoners’ personal experiences. We’ll also read scholars—Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Angela Davis and others—who shed light on the historical repetitions and political exploitations. Guest speakers will include public defenders, parolees, former prisoners, and those fighting for prisoners’ rights and re-entry. Students will gain a more intimate understanding of how the legacies of slavery, racism, the prejudices of class, caste, and misogyny intersect and determine who goes to prison and who does not. Students will free-write for ten minutes a day, every day, and write personal reflections on readings, films, and guest speakers. Responses will lead to essays or stories that students write and present for class discussion. These key pieces may draw from observation, facts and imagination, and may traverse literary nonfiction, memoir, fiction, or poetry.

Introduction to the Ancient Middle East,ANCH 0100,Lecture,In Class,1,"The great pyramids and mysterious mummies of Egypt, the fabled Tower of Babel, and the laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi are some of the things that might come to mind when you think of the ancient Middle East. Yet these are only a very few of the many fascinating -- and at time perplexing -- aspects of the civilizations that flourished there c. 3300-300 BCE. This is where writing first developed, where people thought that the gods wrote down what would happen in the future on the lungs and livers of sacrificed sheep, and where people knew how to determine the length of hypotenuse a thousand years before the Greek Pythagoras was born. During this course, we will learn more about these other matters and discover their place in the cultures and civilizations of that area. This is an interdisciplinary survey of the history, society and culture of the ancient Middle East, in particular Egypt and Mesopotamia, utilizing extensive readings from ancient texts in translation (including the Epic of Gilgamesh, ""one of the great masterpieces of world literature""), but also making use of archaeological and art historical materials. The goal of the course is to gain an appreciation of the various societies of the time, to understand some of their great achievements, to become acquainted with some of the fascinating individuals of the time (such as Hatshepsut, ""the women pharaoh,"" and Akhenaten, ""the heretic king""), and to appreciate the rich heritage that they have left us.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

Strife: A History of the Greeks,ANCH 0101,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"The Greeks enjoy a special place in the construction of western culture and identity, and yet many of us have only the vaguest notion of what their culture was like. A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids, maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks, however, deserves a wider audience, because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, ""Know Thyself."" For us, that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age, c. 1500 BC, down to the time of Alexander the Great, concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire?,ANCH 1102,Lecture,In Class,1,"The Roman Empire, teetering under the weight of its bureaucracy, oppressed by the demands of its soldiers, weakened by wave after wave of barbarian invasions, and, with the rise of Christianity, confronted by its own immorality, finally fell when the last Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was sent into exile in 476 CE. That, at least, is one version of the story. In truth, there are many stories that can be told of the period between the apogee of the Roman empire in the 2nd c. AD and the rise of Christianity and Islam and origins of the so-called Barbarian Kingdoms in the 7th and 8th centuries AD.

Worlds of Late Antiquity,ANCH 6080,Seminar,In Class,1,"The period between the third and eighth centuries - from the Tetrarchy led by Diocletian to the rise of Umayyad Caliphate - is characteristically regarded as a period of ferment and change, whether that be on the still-influential model of Decline and Fall first proposed by Edward Gibbon in the eighteenth century or the somewhat less deterministic account of transformation favored by Peter Brown in the late twentieth. These narratives tend to emphasize the large-scale processes that played out over these centuries, such as the florescence and fragmentation of two world empires; the emergence of two highly influential monotheistic religions of the book; and the codification of legal systems that continue to dominate contemporary practices and theories of law. Equally, what characterizes these centuries is the particular granularity and character of the textual and archaeological evidence that exists for the functioning of this world at the micro-scale, as against the periods that preceded and followed. This course traces the social, economic, cultural, and religious institutions and processes that make this period distinctive, explores the nature of the evidence for those institutions and processes, and exposes to scrutiny the assumptions and preconceptions that underpin the scholarly narratives that have been constructed about them.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Graduate/Research level students.,Not available,T 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),"Kimberly Bowes

"Anthropology, Race, and the Making of the Modern World",ANTH 0020,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"Anthropology as a field is the study of human beings - past, present, and future. It asks questions about what it means to be human, and whether there are universal aspects to human existence. What do we share and how do we differ? What is ""natural"" and what is ""cultural""? What is the relationship between the past and the present? This course is designed to investigate the ways anthropology, as a discipline, emerged in conjunction with European (and later, American) imperialism, the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and the will to know and categorize difference across the world. We will probe the relationships between anthropology and modern race-making by investigating how anthropologists have studied key institutions and systems that structure human life: family and kinship, inequality and hierarchy, race and ethnicity, ritual and symbolic systems, gender and sexuality, reciprocity and exchange, and globalization and social change.

We then examine what studies of nonhuman primates (monkeys and apes) can reveal about our own evolutionary past, reviewing the behavioral and ecological diversity seen among living primates. We conclude the course examining the ""hard"" evidence of human evolution - the fossil and material culture record of human history from our earliest primate ancestors to the emergence of modern Homo sapiens - and also explore the new insights into modern human origins and dispersal provided by genetic studies. We will further examine the nature of human biological variation and discuss the history of scientific racism in physical anthropology.

Hop aboard the Indian Ocean dhows, Chinese junks, Dutch schooners, and British and American clipper ships that made possible the rise of global capitalism, new colonial relationships, and the intensified forms of cultural change. How have the desires to possess and consume particular commodities shaped cultures and the course of modern history? This class introduces students to the cultural history of the modern world through an interdisciplinary analysis of connections between East and West, South and North. Following the circulation of commodities and the development of modern capitalism, the course examines the impact of global exchange on interactions and relationships between regions, nations, cultures, and peoples and the influences on cultural practices and meanings. The role of slavery and labor migrations, colonial and imperial relations, and struggles for economic and political independence are also considered. From the role of spices in the formation of European joint stock companies circa 1600 to the contemporary cocaine trade, the course's use of both original primary sources and secondary readings written by historians and anthropologists will enable particular attention to the ways that global trade has impacted social, cultural, and political formations and practices throughout the world.",Not available,Not available,"ANTH Cultural and Linguistics (AACL)

Globalization And Its Historical Significance,ANTH 0120,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course sets the current state of globalization in historical perspective. It applies the concepts of anthropology, history, political economy and sociology to the study of globalization. We focus on a series of questions not only about what is happening, but about the growing awareness of it and the consequences of this increasing awareness. In answering these questions we draw on a variety of case studies, from historical examples of early globalization (e.g. The Atlantic and Indian Ocean Worlds, global flows of conspicuous commodities such as sugar, coffee, and tea, the rise and transformations of early capitalism), to issues facing our current globalized world (e.g. mass-mediatization and multilingualism, border regimes and international migration, planetary urbanization). The body of the course deals with particular dimensions of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of each. The overall approach is historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of the economic, political and cultural development of various parts of the modern world. The course is taught by anthropologists who draw from economic, linguistic, sociocultural, archaeological, and historical perspectives, offering the opportunity to compare and contrast distinct disciplinary approaches.

In this course we ask: what is performance? How do we describe, analyze, and interpret it? What do theatre and everyday life have in common? How does performance legitimize or challenge the exercise of power? How has social media shifted our understanding of the relationship of our daily lives to performance? How does culture shape what is considered to be performance and how it functions? What isn’t performance? Throughout the semester students will apply key readings in performance theory to case studies drawn from global repertoires of contemporary and historical performance. In addition to analyzing artistic performances, we will also consider sporting events, celebrations, political events, and the performance of everyday life.

"Museums, Monuments, and Social Justice",ANTH 1410,Lecture,In Class,1,"Monuments, museums, and heritage are all critical parts of the world that we have created and are shaped by. These institutions and sites often claim to represent our past, who we imagine ourselves to be today, and how we might define our futures. We often rely on museums and monuments to frame history and history’s relationship to our current social and cultural systems. However, in recent years, social, racial, and economic justice movements have pushed us to rethink the function of monuments, museums, and heritage. In particular, these social movements have helped us understand how racism, sexism, and colonialism are responsible for the creation of monuments and museums. This course examines the echoes and continuities of colonial representations in museums and monuments. In addition, we will examine how new ways of commemorating and representing the past can result in a new vision for our future. By visiting a variety of local monuments and sites and by engaging in conversations about accountability and social justice, this course will challenge us to rethink the tangible and intangible ways that we weave the past into the present for the creation of the future.","Here in Philadelphia today, we continue to grapple with historical monuments including statues of Frank Rizzo and Christopher Columbus. In addition, there has been a call for the Penn Museum to be accountable for the return and repatriation of human remains.",Not available,"ANCH Greco-Roman Culture (AANB)

World Musics and Cultures,ANTH 1500,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course examines how we as consumers in the ""Western"" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of ""World Music"" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.

In others, people do not have access to basic or life-saving drugs. Individuals struggle to afford medications; whole populations are neglected, considered too poor to constitute profitable markets for the development and distribution of necessary drugs. This seminar analyzes the dynamics of the burgeoning international pharmaceutical trade and the global inequalities that emerge from and are reinforced by market-driven medicine. Questions about who will be treated and who will not filter through every phase of pharmaceutical production --from preclinical research to human testing, marketing, distribution, prescription, and consumption. Whether considering how the pharmaceutical industry shapes popular understandings of mental illness in North America and Great Britain, how Brazil has created a model of HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment program, or how the urban pooer in Delhi understand and access healthcare, the seminar draws on anthropological case studies to illuminate the roles of corporations, governments, non-governmental organizations, and individuals in relation to global pharmaceuticals. As we analyze each case and gain famliarity with tehnographic methods, we will ask how individual and group health is shaped by new medical technologies and their evolving regulatory regimes and markets.

The decipherment of Maya script and advances in archaeological techniques, including aerial LiDAR scanning and isotopic analysis, are combining with art historical and literary sources to transform our understanding of a culture that ranks among the most famous, but enigmatic, on this continent. The ability to read Maya inscriptions has created the first historical archaeology for the ancient Americas, giving access to an Indigenous voice that has been silent for more than a millennium—with implications not only for scholarship but for the efforts of descendent peoples in asserting a modern Maya identity with existing Latin American states.

Though the two disciplines have long studied overlapping topics, the contribution of anthropological work to bioethical discussions and associated health policy interventions has been limited. This course will investigate whether and how anthropology can contribute to ethics and characterize the unique perspective that the discipline adds to bioethics topics. We will begin by carrying out an anthropology of bioethics, exploring how bioethics developed as a field with a specific philosophical and political orientation and a particular conception of which issues in health, illness, and medicine are worthy of attention as ethical problems. Next, we will clarify how anthropology can contribute to bioethical theory and debate by considering decades-old, ongoing debates about the relevance of (descriptive) social scientific findings to the development of (prescriptive) bioethics frameworks. Finally, we will apply an anthropological lens to bioethical problems. We will use anthropology's global, ethnographic orientation to explore a series of classic bioethics topics (e.g., the rights of research subjects, the allocation of medical resources, the uses of genetic testing, the withdrawal of life-sustaining care), examining how anthropologists' conclusions about these topics might differ from bioethicists', why, and with what ramifications.",Not available,Not available,"BIOE Clinical Ethics (ABEC)

"Reproduction, Justice and Care: Listening in Philly",ANTH 3867,Seminar,In Class,1,"In this class, you will be introduced to reproductive justice as a holistic theory and a methodological framework that can guide the practice of medicine and anthropology. You will create an oral history with a Philly-based community activist, midwife, doula, or other practitioner whose work engages with reproductive justice, understood expansively as the right to have children, to not have children, and to parent children in healthy environments free from violence and state oppression. At the end of the class, we will release these oral histories together as part of a new season of CEE’s “Reckoning and Repair in Philadelphia” podcast. Recent reports in Philadelphia have called particular attention to the severity of the maternal health crisis in the city, where black birthing people are more than four times as likely to die of preventable causes than their white peers. Such inequalities are not unique or new; Philadelphia was a crucial site where medicine broadly and obstetrics more specifically were born… . Philadelphia is the first city in the United States to have an obstetric society, and it is also the educational home of the so-called father of gynecology, James Marion Sims, who notoriously experimented on enslaved women to develop foundational obstetric procedures still in use today. At the same time, Philadelphia has also been an activist stronghold, as a site of historical Black, Caribbean, Latinx, and immigrant organizing and community care for more than a century. Today, midwives, doulas, doctors, environmental justice workers and others continue to develope nurturing models of child, maternal, and familial care that uplift communities. Many of these have been informed by reproductive justice frameworks. Engaging with a long tradition of scholar-activist ethnography, we will turn to the experiences of these community organizers, birthworkers, midwives, and doulas to gain an understanding of their battles for reproductive justice in Philadelphia: from the persistent inequities in maternal medical care, to the community work to create safe neighborhoods, to patient rights education campaigns, to medical interventions within prisons. Working one-on-one with a partner engaged in this work, students will produce an oral history of reproductive justice in Philadelphia. In the process students will learn crucial methods of critical medical anthropology, and build their skills in ethnographic listening as both a research method and a potentially transformative act of care. It is open to students with all levels of experience, including those with no prior background in audio/media production Through your podcast episodes, you'll answer the following questions: 1. How have historical medical practices and medical cultures in Philadelphia, especially in the context of clinical obstetric care, shaped the current disparities and challenges in reproductive health? 2. What cultural, social, and economic factors have influenced the development of homegrown methods of care within Philadelphia's reproductive justice community, and what do these practices provide (or avoid) that hospital practices do not? 3. How do the experiences and perspectives of doula, reproductive justice workers, and health practitioners intersect with or challenge established medical paradigms? 4. What good does listening and documenting these stories of care and resistance in reproductive justice do, if anything, at the personal, social, and institutional level.

Critical Ethnography,ANTH 5500,Seminar,In Class,1,"""This graduate course introduces students to theories, practices, and critiques of critical ethnography. Ethnography -- an approach to the study of culture which anthropologist James Clifford described as a process that ""translates experiences into text"" - will have our full attention. This process of translation, although seemingly straightforward, requires layers of interpretation, selection, and the imposition of a viewpoint or politics. While ethnography is often narrowly conceived of as a methodology, this course considers ethnography as a mode of inquiry, as a philosophy, as an ongoing question and performance. We wrestle with notions of ""the self"" and ""the other"" at the intersection of imbricated cultural and performance worlds. Together we'll ask: How is ethnography both critical and performative? What is the relationship between theory and method? How can we evaluate ethnographic work? And finally, what kinds of ethnographers do we want to be? This course considers a range of ethnographic examples in order to analyze both the craft and the stakes of ""translating experiences into text.""",Not available,Not available,ANTH Cultural and Linguistics (AACL),T 12pm-2:59pm (8/27 to 12/9),Jasmine Johnson,,,,,AFRC 5500,,,[1.0]

"Footage Films, or Narrating a Dataset",ANTH 6668,Seminar,In Class,1,"We begin this course with a moratorium on audio-video capture. A hundred days without your own images:) We will attempt instead to collectively and then sequentially author a set of video essays that engage with material that we are already deeply enmeshed in. That are typically too vast, ""thin"", that either overflow or flow beneath representational or affective media. Examples of what we could make here would be: a video essay on the Wikileaks dataset of global US Embassy shopping lists, a film made from the Radia phone taps, and so on. This course draws on CAMP's learnings from running an open-access footage archive, Pad.ma and related projects, since 2007. Pad.ma asked: what is the ethical and political relation between the category footage (""found"", shot in large quantities, with good intentions, left in shoe boxes or dying hard disks) and the category ""film"". Footage is the raw material, but does it also tell us how film is made, and whether it is beautiful on the inside. That film is made from footage, seems tautological. But in the process we will follow, any simple relation between footage and film is shattered into a multitude of moves by imagers, sounders, writers, editors, narrators and materials. We are inspired by Elizaveta Svilova, editor of ""Man with the Movie Camera"" carefully indexing, splicing and assembling pieces of film (intercutting them with images of women's work - patching phone lines, sewing, or painting fingernails), and that of her contemporary, Esfir Shub who was foraging cellars, gathering, restoring and compiling footage into films, a hundred years ago. Extending the footage metaphor to other media, we enter a vast terrain of over-collected materials. Health, insurance and other management databases, surveillance data, cctv streams, most of what the modern media industry is made of and which Matt Fuller and Andrew Goffey called Evil Media. Archive or be archived, we said in 2010. But the questions have moved beyond archival ones, to questions of what can be done with archives by situated subjects. We begin by identifying footage collections or datasets that we can situate ourselves in, individually or as a group. We evolve narrative and editorial strategies within a Pad.ma - like interface via group annotations in a process called three-ing. In the second half of the course the participants develop a series of video essays. We see this as a counter-AI process of assimilation. At the end, we may also recognise that there are missing images - and if there is need for us to film, and if so why, with whom, and how. This prepares participants ethically and formally to go forth in the world to create really new images.

"Reproduction, Justice, and Care: Listening in Philly",ANTH 6867,Seminar,In Class,1,"Course Summary In this class, you will be introduced to reproductive justice as a holistic theory and a methodological framework that can guide the practice of medicine and anthropology. You will create an oral history with a Philly-based community activist, midwife, doula, or other practitioner whose work engages with reproductive justice, understood expansively as the right to have children, to not have children, and to parent children in healthy environments free from violence and state oppression. At the end of the class, we will release these oral histories together as part of a new season of CEE’s “Reckoning and Repair in Philadelphia” podcast. Recent reports in Philadelphia have called particular attention to the severity of the maternal health crisis in the city, where black birthing people are more than four times as likely to die of preventable causes than their white peers. Such inequalities are not unique or new; Philadelphia was a crucial site where medicine broadly and obstetrics more specifically were born… . Philadelphia is the first city in the United States to have an obstetric society, and it is also the educational home of the so-called father of gynecology, James Marion Sims, who notoriously experimented on enslaved women to develop foundational obstetric procedures still in use today. At the same time, Philadelphia has also been an activist stronghold, as a site of historical Black, Caribbean, Latinx, and immigrant organizing and community care for more than a century. Today, midwives, doulas, doctors, environmental justice workers and others continue to develope nurturing models of child, maternal, and familial care that uplift communities. Many of these have been informed by reproductive justice frameworks. Engaging with a long tradition of scholar-activist ethnography, we will turn to the experiences of these community organizers, birthworkers, midwives, and doulas to gain an understanding of their battles for reproductive justice in Philadelphia: from the persistent inequities in maternal medical care, to the community work to create safe neighborhoods, to patient rights education campaigns, to medical interventions within prisons. Working one-on-one with a partner engaged in this work, students will produce an oral history of reproductive justice in Philadelphia. In the process students will learn crucial methods of critical medical anthropology, and build their skills in ethnographic listening as both a research method and a potentially transformative act of care. It is open to students with all levels of experience, including those with no prior background in audio/media production Through your podcast episodes, you'll answer the following questions: 1. How have historical medical practices and medical cultures in Philadelphia, especially in the context of clinical obstetric care, shaped the current disparities and challenges in reproductive health? 2. What cultural, social, and economic factors have influenced the development of homegrown methods of care within Philadelphia's reproductive justice community, and what do these practices provide (or avoid) that hospital practices do not? 3. How do the experiences and perspectives of doula, reproductive justice workers, and health practitioners intersect with or challenge established medical paradigms? 4. What good does listening and documenting these stories of care and resistance in reproductive justice do, if anything, at the personal, social, and institutional level.

We consider changing modes of production and reception, disciplinary and institutional innovations, animating debates, and global interdependencies and interchanges . Going well beyond iconic buildings and canonical “isms,” we pose the following questions: In what ways did the new architecture of the period respond to, participate in, and mediate the unprecedented experiences of modernizing societies? How did urban and environmental crises, colonial enterprises and devastating wars, national and international agendas, social changes, and technological advances affect architects’ understanding of the spaces they were called upon to design? How, in turn, did buildings and projects reflect different societies’ self-images and aspirations to become modern? What can architecture’s manifestations over the course of this formative period tell us about the emergent modern world?

In support of this task, students will learn the surrounding theoretical context by studying key texts from Ruskin, Mostafavi and Leatherbarrow, Kallipoliti, Morton and Bennet that focus on the topics of weathering, ruination and contemporary ecological ideas; where and why these various effects occur in the built environment at present; and procedural design, modelling workflows in Houdini FX that integrate computational intelligence through weather simulation and geometric analysis.",Not available,Enrollment limited to students in the Weitzman School Professional division.,Not available,M 7pm-9:59pm (8/27 to 12/9),Barry Wark,,,,,,,,[1.0]

Semi-Fictitious Realms: A History and Future of Virtual Reality,ARCH 7370,Seminar,In Class,1,"The pursuit of immersive digital experiences has long been a goal of the computing industry. Early wearable displays designed in the 1960s depicted simple three-dimensional graphics in ways that had never been seen before. Through trial and error, digital pioneers reframed the relationship between user and machine, and over the last ﬁve decades, have made strides that advanced both the input and output mechanisms we are so comfortable with today. As a ﬁeld, architecture has been reliant on these advancements to design and document buildings, but these tools still leave the architect removed from the physicality of the design, with their work depicted as 2D lines or 3D planes alone. This course will study the evolutionary advancements made that now allow us to fully inhabit digital worlds through Virtual Reality. Using the Unity Video Game Engine, students will generate immersive, photo-realistic models of unbuilt architectural works and explore digital/physical interactivity. These models will be designed to have compatibility with both 6-DOF and 3-DOF Virtual Reality equipment as well as flythrough-style experiences for keyboard and mouse using various web-hosting platforms.

New Approaches to an Architecture of Health,ARCH 7390,Seminar,In Class,1,"Health care is taking on a new role in our society - with a refocusing from episodic care for those who are ill or symptomatic to providing life-long care geared towards maintaining wellness. These changes are evident across numerous areas of design, from wearable technologies that track and analyze, to large scale building initiatives that aim to create healthier environments and improve lives through strategic planning initiatives. A concrete, physical representation of this paradigm shift can be found within the hospital building itself and in the new manner in which hospitals are looking to serve their patients and care for their clinicians. Simultaneously both public and private spaces, hospitals are complex systems in which sickness, health, hospitality, technology, emergency, and community share space and compete for resource. In order to frame our present day understanding of the role of architecture (and design) in fostering health for individuals and within communities, this seminar will begin with an exploration of the historical and contemporary perspectives on the role of the architect and built environment on health. (Parallels between design and our ever-changing understanding of the biological, social, and environmental causes of sickness and disease will also be explored.) During this conversation, students will read articles and study recently constructed projects in order to examine the ways in which the architects approached these topics through built form. Following from this foundation, students will craft arguments for a new approach to the individual, the community, health, and architecture through a written response and architecturally designed scenario that argues for their perspective on how architecture can and should shape the health of those who inhabit it. Throughout the course, students will engage in weekly readings (and discussions) of critical texts exploring ideas around the role and impact of architecture on health.

"Museums, Monuments, and Social Justice",ARTH 0141,Lecture,In Class,1,"Monuments, museums, and heritage are all critical parts of the world that we have created and are shaped by. These institutions and sites often claim to represent our past, who we imagine ourselves to be today, and how we might define our futures. We often rely on museums and monuments to frame history and history’s relationship to our current social and cultural systems. However, in recent years, social, racial, and economic justice movements have pushed us to rethink the function of monuments, museums, and heritage. In particular, these social movements have helped us understand how racism, sexism, and colonialism are responsible for the creation of monuments and museums. This course examines the echoes and continuities of colonial representations in museums and monuments. In addition, we will examine how new ways of commemorating and representing the past can result in a new vision for our future.

Introduction to Queer Art,ARTH 1800,Lecture,In Class,1,"It's no exaggeration to note that queers have long been at the forefront of innovation in the arts, and that the arts, generally, have been a comfortable home for queers, even at moments when society at large was distinctly hostile. In fact the concepts of modern art and homosexuality that we use today are twins, for they were both founded in the third quarter of the 19th century and grew up together. Introduction to Queer Art thus begins with the coining of the word ""homosexual"" in 1869, and surveys how a range of mediums including painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and film shifted in response to new definitions of sexuality. Along the way, we will work towards answering two related questions: 1) Why were queer creators largely responsible for the introduction of modernity in the arts, and 2) why do we find so often that queer social and political dissent found form in, and as, aesthetic dissent as well? In creating new forms for art that often seem far removed from any traditional definition of sexuality, including non-objective and abstract art, queer artists pushed the boundaries of normativity, leading to new ways of seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking that often dared to encode queer meanings as part of their formal innovation. We will look into the politics of queer art, and how and why in the US, even amidst often dangerous homophobia, it was queer artists who represented America to itself. Thus, we will cover such key cultural figures such as Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Frank O'Hara, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Agnes Martin. Throughout, new methods informed by queer, gender, and critical race theory will be utilized.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cultural Diversity in US (AUCD)

What is Contemporary Art?,ARTH 1900,Lecture,In Class,1,"What is contemporary art? When is contemporary art? For whom is contemporary art? Where is contemporary art? And… why does contemporary art matter? This survey introduces us to some central artists, themes, works, and debates currently comprising the history of contemporary art, with a particular focus on the social, racial, and political engagements that have informed artistic developments, as well as how they are historicized in relation to other art and geopolitical events, globally. We consider the ways in which artists have approached, contested, reflected, and reconfigured the problems and possibilities of institutions in order to find critical traction and build historical context. We also look at how globalization, technology, racialization, and capitalism have all shaped artistic production, art criticism, and the art market, while also reflecting upon the temporality of our present and what it is that is “contemporary” to our “now.”",Not available,Not available,"ARTH Elective Major/Minor (AHAE)

Prints and Politics: From the Early Modern Era to Now,ARTH 2621,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course offers a history of how mechanically reproducible images reshaped the social world. Beginning in the fifteenth century in Europe, these media connected new audiences across geographies by providing access to the same visual information. Prints launched propagandistic missions, fomented rebellion against authorities, and built networks of progressive thinkers who could envision alternative futures. Prints played a key role in developing what constituted news. Mass-distributed images delivered the mistreatment of the “Indians” by the Spanish and portrayed the packing of Africans on a slave ship. Goya’s etchings protested the repression of the Second of May uprising. The silkscreens of Andy Warhol repeated the image of police dogs attacking civil rights activists in Birmingham. Covering a five-hundred-year history, this course will focus on how printed images created communities and acted as exclusionary devices.

Sex in the Museum,ARTH 2872,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course maps the often fraught intercourse between the history of sexuality and the history of museums, exhibitions, and curation. Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition. Beginning in the ancient world and moving into the present, this course studies the sexual politics of display, inherent but little studied, in the history of art history. From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe’s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world. Whether coming to understand the so-called “Free Body Culture” of turn of the 20th century Europe with its very public nudity, to the explosion in nude performance in the 1960s to the culture wars of the 1980s in the USA over an art that addressed queerness, AIDS, and their intersection, we’ll see how often exhibitions have served as proxy for other social and political issues. In this course we’ll also come to understand the distinction between the nude, a category in art, and the naked, a category that was often said to corrupt art. Reading the latest work in queer, feminist and anti-racist scholarship, we will see how easily bodies on display can turn into sex, and conversely, slip as easily back from sex into bodies again.",Not available,Not available,"ARTH Elective Major/Minor (AHAE)

Venice Biennale Spiegel-Wilks Seminar: Foreigners Everywhere,ARTH 3060,Seminar,In Class,1,"Founded in 1895, the Venice Biennale (La Biennale di Venezia) is one of the art world’s most prestigious venues for contemporary art. In this seminar, we will consider the history of the Venice Biennale, its curatorial process for group shows, the role of national pavilions, and related topics, within the larger frame of the international art world. How contemporary artists cross boundaries, challenge expectations, and respond to the site itself are also key issues. The seminar focus will be adapted in each iteration according to the expertise of the instructor, and students will be funded to travel with the instructor to Venice over fall break as part of this site seminar. This course is open to History of Art Juniors and Seniors, admission by permission only.","This seminar considers the history and context of the Venice Biennale along with other major biennials in terms of nationalism, market conditions, and exhibitionary trends in order to prepare students to travel (airfare/accommodation paid by the Department) to the 2024 Venice Biennial from 10/2-10/8. The theme of this year’s Biennial, “Foreigners Everywhere,” curated by Adriano Pedrosa, allows us also to study contemporary art in relation to migration, diaspora, and exile, focusing on artists featured in the exhibition and their relationship to this year’s theme, which was selected to highlight continued and urgent preoccupation with regional and intranational conflict, religion, environmental catastrophe, questions of belonging and exclusion, art communities “at risk,” genocide and political violence, gender, ethnicity, and the power of boycott. Seeing the artworks in person allows us to study how these concerns translate into aesthetic forms with particular and universal legibility. Interested students should write Prof. Feldman (Feldman.h@gmail.com) in advance of April 15, with subject line: Spiegel-Wilks Application.“ Please state your year, exposure to/education with regards to contemporary art, travel experience and possibilities to travel in the future, and intellectual reasons for wanting to take the course.

To capture the rich diversity in Christian experience and expression, we will turn to the material practices of religion and explore how things, places, and bodily acts shaped what it meant to be Christian. Building on insights drawn from archaeology, art history, anthropology, and religious studies, we will seek to recover the experiences of diverse and often marginalized subjects and communities, and in the process, will problematize the categories of religion, authority, and identity.

Early Modern Art Theory Seminar: Portraits of the Medici and the Early Modern Self,ARTH 5503,Seminar,In Class,1,Reading and discussion of texts relevant to open problems and key issues pertaining to Renaissance and Baroque art (1500-1800) in Europe and beyond with emphasis on Italy and Brazil.,"Undergraduates may enroll with permission. How do we portray ourselves? How do we portray others? In this seminar we will ponder the historical and critical stakes of portraiture as they relate to images of the Medici Family, the famed (and infamous) dynasty which played a significant role in history, politics, art, and culture from the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries in Italy and beyond. Moving chronologically, we will show how the function of portraiture evolved as the family advanced its political ambitions and augmented its social status. Our course will include portraits made in service of self-fashioning for local audiences as well as international ones, for intimates and allies as well as enemies; it will cover portraits made in response to religious, humanistic and dynastic imperatives and even to a lesser extent —in the 16th century— papal ideology. We will demonstrate that portraiture was one of the mainstays in the family’s strategies of cultural preeminence. In addition to learning about the culture of “Renaissance” and “Baroque” Florence, students will have the unique opportunity to participate in the programming related to the exhibition “Beyond the Medici: The Haukohl Family Collection,” which will open at the Arthur Ross Gallery during the Fall Semester 2024.

Prints and Politics: From the Early Modern Era to Now,ARTH 6621,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course offers a history of how mechanically reproducible images reshaped the social world. Beginning in the fifteenth century in Europe, these media connected new audiences across geographies by providing access to the same visual information. Prints launched propagandistic missions, fomented rebellion against authorities, and built networks of progressive thinkers who could envision alternative futures. Prints played a key role in developing what constituted news. Mass-distributed images delivered the mistreatment of the “Indians” by the Spanish and portrayed the packing of Africans on a slave ship. Goya’s etchings protested the repression of the Second of May uprising. The silkscreens of Andy Warhol repeated the image of police dogs attacking civil rights activists in Birmingham. Covering a five-hundred-year history, this course will focus on how printed images created communities and acted as exclusionary devices.

Sex in the Museum,ARTH 6872,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course maps the often fraught intercourse between the history of sexuality and the history of museums, exhibitions, and curation. Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition. Beginning in the ancient world and moving into the present, this course studies the sexual politics of display, inherent but little studied, in the history of art history. From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe’s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world. Whether coming to understand the so-called “Free Body Culture” of turn of the 20th century Europe with its very public nudity, to the explosion in nude performance in the 1960s to the culture wars of the 1980s in the USA over an art that addressed queerness, AIDS, and their intersection, we’ll see how often exhibitions have served as proxy for other social and political issues. In this course we’ll also come to understand the distinction between the nude, a category in art, and the naked, a category that was often said to corrupt art. Reading the latest work in queer, feminist and anti-racist scholarship, we will see how easily bodies on display can turn into sex, and conversely, slip as easily back from sex into bodies again.",Not available,Undergraduate level students may not enroll.,Not available,MW 10:15am-11:44am (8/27 to 12/9),Jonathan Katz,,,,,GSWS 6872,ARTH 2872,,[1.0]

Medieval Art Seminar: Metal/Work: Dialectics of Matter and Form,ARTH 7400,Seminar,In Class,1,"Alternating specific topic from year to year, this advanced graduate seminar surveys methodological issues concerning the art of the European Middle Ages, broadly conceived. Seminars take advantage of the rich resources of the Philadelphia area. This course is open to graduate students only.","This graduate seminar breaks down the traditional art historical category “metalwork” into its component parts—metal and work—to propose that each of these terms provides a methodological framework from which to approach the study of this medium. Upheld in pre-modern periods for both its material worth and the technical expertise required to craft its raw matter into forms, metalwork in the modern era was relegated to the margins of the discipline as one of the “minor” or “decorative” arts. A few factors now stimulate renewed study of pre-modern metalwork. While the material turn has called for recognition of the inherent properties of precious alloy and histories of scientific and pseudo-scientific epistemologies study alchemical attempts to produce gold, the object of this course is to focus on the varieties of labour required for this most resource intensive art form. We will consider period efforts to source expensive and difficult to unearth materials (gold, silver, gems, etc.) as well as the politics of organizing such extractive methods. We will examine technical practices, from filigree to casting massive bronze, which demand advanced skill, take their toll on the body, and consume environmental resources. By taking the medieval and early modern periods as our focus, we probe the status of these demanding objects at a time before painting became synonymous with “art.” Topics will include: mining and metalworking techniques, the organization of craft guilds, trade in raw materials, political philosophies of resource allocation, as well as the provisioning of labour across these economies, both free and un-free. We propose centering our discussions around the extraordinary collections and intact industrial history of Prague, Kutná Hora, and Karlstein castle, and the course will be organized around travel to these sites. The silver mine of Kutná Hora, and the taler there produced (antecedent for the North American dollar), financed the imperial and artistic ambitions of the Holy Roman Empire. In our seminar, we will develop critical methods for studying the intersection of material and labor histories and political authority.",Undergraduate level students may not enroll.,"ARTH PHD 700-Level Seminar (HMS7)

For the Spring 2021 semester, the topic will be: Portraiture Now. This graduate seminar examines approaches to portraiture by contemporary artists in the United States and beyond, with a focus on artists of color. We will consider painting, sculpture, photography, prints, drawings, time based media, and conceptual portraiture.","“Can one have a history of images that treats pictures as more than simply a reflection of something else, something more important happening elsewhere? Is it possible to envisage history as in part determined by struggles occurring at the level of the visual?” Christopher Pinney, Photos of the Gods: The Printed Image and Political Struggle in India. This seminar takes partial charge from the question with which the anthropologist Christopher Pinney starts his study of chromolithography and colonial resistance in India, bringing it to bear more broadly on the ways in which we approach the photographic image, especially as it was first conceptualized and continues to be practiced in regions beyond Europe. Whereas it is now largely agreed that photography was not “invented” in one particular place or moment, but rather “announced” as a suite of nearly simultaneous discoveries, studies of the photographic and, in particular, its place in contemporary culture, still largely depend on a handful of ideas about representation, vision, and visuality that derive from western epistemologies and the logics built into the languages in which they were articulated. So, against a history of photography that has treated the medium as variously defined ontologically by its mechanical nature, its indexical nature, or its capacity to represent or replace the real, we will try to understand how the functioning capacity of the image, its use, and reception exceed these western models such that photographs come to take on the life of material objects; become opportunities for imagination and not documentation; become animate as well as theatrical; and, provide us with sites through which we might re-vision the certainty with which we approach time and space as the coordinates of the real and hence the strata (and data) of history. Further moving away from the idea that the photograph documents and preserves in the present events or people that are now past, we look to an even more complicated temporality that approaches the various ways in which photography is embedded in a future oriented thinking that allows us to see what is not physically (yet) there, or not (yet) visible—the apparently invisible or unimaginable, in fact: things and possibilities we have considered foregone. To do so, we will consider photography as situated in other epistemologies and faith-based understandings of life, death, and the real.",Undergraduate level students may not enroll.,SEAS Humanities (EUHS),W 12pm-2:59pm (8/27 to 12/9),Not available,,,,,,,,[1.0]

"Beyond ""Hate"": Violence in Asian American History",ASAM 1170,Lecture,In Class,1,"Since 2020, national media, political leaders, and nonprofit organizations have all called attention to a rise in what they labeled “anti-Asian hate.” But what does this framing of hate, and its centering of individual acts of hate violence, tell us about the roots of anti-Asian violence? This course takes recent attention to anti-Asian hate as a point of departure to investigate the history of anti-Asian violence as constitutive to the United States as a nation and an empire. Taking a historical and theoretical approach to the concept of violence, we will consider why certain forms of violence are privileged and others silenced within conversations about racial violence. Through a range of historical, cultural, and scholarly texts, students will examine different genres of violence throughout Asian American history, including state, imperial, gender-based, and hate violence. From 19th century lynchings of early Chinese migrants to post-9/11 Islamophobia, this course traces the function of violence as a tool for the racialization and disciplining of Asian bodies.

This course will survey the different facets of political life in Asian American communities, focusing on three major themes. First, we will examine the origins and evolution of “Asian America” as a political project. Second, we will explore how Asian Americans have been engaging in a variety of political arenas, from electoral politics to community organizing. We will consider topics such as voting, political representation, and grassroots activisms around gentrification, anti-Asian violence, and immigrant detention and deportation. Third, we will consider the politics of interminority relations; in other words, how Asian Americans engage with other communities of color. We will focus on the political and ethical questions around affirmative action, Black Lives Matter, and multi-racial solidarity. Throughout the course, we will grapple with the multiplicities and pluralities of Asian Americans, including both the limitations and possibilities of identity politics in a diversifying America.",Not available,Not available,"ASAM Minor Related Courses (AASR)

Global Chinas and Chinese Diasporas,ASAM 2620,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar delves into the global imprint of contemporary Chinese diasporic communities, examining their significant influence from the lens of multiple sectors and regions—from Wenzhou migrants shaping the fashion industry in Italy to copper mining enterprises in Zambia to Chinese-owned nail salons and massage parlors dotting New York City. This exploration situates Chinese communities within the context of an interconnected world. As China has ascended to become the world’s second-largest economy, its impact is not confined within its borders but extends into international politics, culture, commerce, technology, and beyond. This class endeavors to unpack the complexities of China’s global engagement and deepen students’ understanding of Chinese communities worldwide. The course is divided into two main sections. The first section provides an overview of the historical journey of China on the global stage and an introduction to research methods specific to studying this phenomenon.

Why do we sometimes get our way, while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Over the past few decades, research in social psychology and decision science has sought the answer to this question and created a rich body of knowledge on bargaining behavior, leading to a well-validated prescription on how to negotiate. In this course, you will learn both the how and the why of negotiation behavior. Through role-playing exercises, you will be able to evaluate your own negotiation behavior as well as that of your classmates and receive advice on how to optimize it to achieve your desired outcomes.

In this sense, this is a class on theoretical statistics, but we will go beyond theory to apply these methods to answer our own research questions. As such, this is also a class on applied statistics. We will rely heavily on statistical programming languages (namely, R) and version control systems (Git) to create statistical reports. Finally, we will work with new research in the field and learn to critically assess the statistical methods used therein.

Philanthropy and Health,BENF 2230,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course that brings together the recent literature from the social sciences and health sciences as well as other disciplines to explore how philanthropy impacts health care in society at large, and in particular, the health of the donor and volunteer. Furthermore, the course will include an ""ideas in action"" component. Students will examine philanthropic donations at work in Philadelphia, as well as engage in philanthropic activities alongside the instructor. The course consists of three parts: Part 1) Philanthropy and Healthcare in Society: The US has a long tradition of channeling philanthropic resources to augment healthcare in society, as the demand for health care exceeds the capacity of individuals or government to fully satisfy the demand. Philanthropic resources, which include both time and money, are emerging as significant means by which the capacity of the healthcare sector is fortified; these include resources for service providers, health care researchers, and health care policy advocates. To understand the heterogeneous impact of philanthropy on healthcare, this part of the course will examine the ""who, what, when, where, and how"" of philanthropic inputs into healthcare and their impact. Part 2) Health Effects on the Individual Philanthropist: The second part of the course examines individuals who give of their time and money. From decreased mortality to better health outcomes, researchers have carefully documented the effect on individual givers. Recent findings from the health sciences also show what mechanisms might be involved in an individual's psychology and physiology that can explain the beneficial health effects of philanthropic behavior. We will examine recent experimental research along these lines provides further evidence along these lines. Part 3) Ideas in Action: The course will include three specific volunteering events and do so by selecting a healthcare related organization of their choice that uses philanthropic resources. Students will gain first-hand experience as volunteers (and if feasible, as donors) and discuss their experiences with philanthropy in class presentations and relate them to course content.",Not available,Enrollment in this course is restricted.

Consumer Financial Decision Making,BEPP 2020,Lecture,In Class,1,"Research shows that many individuals are profoundly underinformed about important financial facts and financial products, which frequently lead them to make mistakes and lose money. Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances. Although academic research has historically placed more attention on corporate finance, household finance is receiving a brighter spotlight now-- partly due to its role in the recent financial crisis.

Managerial Economics,BEPP 2500,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course will introduce you to ""managerial economics"" which is the application of microeconomic theory to managerial decision-making. Microeconomic theory is a remarkably useful body of ideas for understanding and analyzing the behavior of individuals and firms in a variety of economic settings. The goal of the course is for you to understand this body of theory well enough so that you can effectively analyze managerial (and other) problems in an economic framework. While this is a ""tools"" course, we will cover many real-world applications, particularly business applications, so that you can witness the usefulness of these tools and acquire the skills to use them yourself. We will depart from the usual microeconomic theory course by giving more emphasis to prescription: What should a manager do in order to achieve some objective? That course deliverable is to compare with description: Why do firms and consumers act the way they do? The latter will still be quite prominent in this course because only by understanding how other firms and customers behave can a manager determine what is beswt for him or her to do. Strategic interaction is explored both in product markets and auctions. Finally, the challenges created by asymmetric information - both in the market and within the firm - are investigated.",Varies by section,Varies by section,"NU Sector ReaSys&Relationship (NURS)

Business Analytics with Data for Non-Coders,BEPP 6130,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This 0.5 CU course merges the instruction offered in Managerial Economics with data to flesh out related concepts with practical business applications. The purpose of the course is to close the gap between the theory of business analytics and its actual practice, i.e., how you can really use it in your practice. More than ever, there is a need for business leaders to become more data literate: “Business leaders at every level need to become data literate and be able to understand data and analytical concepts that may have previously seemed out of reach, including statistical methods, machine learning, and data manipulation. With this spread of data literacy comes the powerful ability to make educated business decisions that rely on the smart use of data, rather than on an individual’s opinions. In the past, these tasks were extremely complex and would be handed off to engineers. With the tools that exist today, business leaders are able to dive into their own analytics and uncover powerful insights.” (Microsoft) You will learn how to conduct in-depth business analytics based on sensible economics reasoning. As the main project, you will build an end-to-end business workflow. The problem and data can come from a current employer, from your own startup idea, or, from the instructor to represent a hypothetical setting. In the tradition of MGEC, the course will also motivate future electives to refine components of your analysis. Ultimately, you will walk away from the course with a fuller understanding of how different business and economics concepts “fit together” to answer big, relevant questions. Your new skillset is repeatable for your future projects. You will also learn key ideas that allow you to work with future coding teams in your future work, thereby closing the language gap between business economic goals and coding implementation. Normally, this type of comprehensive problem solving would require using coding languages like Python or R. However, the instructor for this course has developed a no-code toolbox that can be used with Microsoft Excel that allows for end-to-end analytics, making data analytics accessible to a much wider audience. This software will be provided for free to you.","NOTICE TO MBA STUDENTS: MBA students must request enrollment for this class through Course Match and should not use the ""Add to Cart"" or ""Request Permission"" functions.

Global Bioethics,BIOE 5720,Lecture,In Class,1,"According to the WHO, around 30 million people with HIV/AIDS should receive anti-retroviral treatment. But only 10 million do. Drugs containing tenofovir--the standard of care in developed countries are expensive. Stavudine-based treatments are much cheaper but have worse side-effects. Is it ethical to use stavudine-based rather than tenofovir-based treatments in sub-Saharan Africa? Smoking rates have decreased drastically in most developed countries. But they are increasing in many developing countries. Established public health measures are not implemented, and the tobacco industry pursues a range of marketing activities that would be unacceptable in developed countries. As a consequence, global deaths from smoking are expected to increase to 1bn by the end of the 21st century, with 80% of deaths in developing countries. Is industry s behavior immoral or normal in a global market? ARDS is a disease of premature newborns. Is it ethical to test a new ARDS drug in Bolivia if the drug--if proven to be effective-- will be very expensive and accessible only to the richest people in Bolivia and other developing countries? An overarching question that these different cases raise is whether there are universal ethical standards that should apply to all people, or whether regional variations should be acceptable. Universalists typically argue that there must be no double standards, and that people should be treated the same regardless of where they live. Pragmatists raise concerns about moral imperialism, neo-colonialism, or insufficient respect for cultural or other differences. Increasing globalization fuels debates about which of competing sets of moral standards is the right one. Looking at a range of diverse cases including healthcare research, health policy, flu pandemics, family planning, smoking and obesity policy, and genetically modified crops, this course explores controversies in the cross winds of market forces, politics and ethics, and examines the roles and responsibilities of key actors and international policy guidance.",Not available,Undergraduate level students may not enroll.,"BIOE Allocation (ABEA)

Emerging Infectious Diseases,CAMB 6170,Lecture,In Class,1,"A physician from just 25 years ago would not recognize two of today's most pressing public health problems, AIDS and Hepatitis C, nor be familiar with many other infectious diseases or agents including MERS, Ebola virus, Hantaanvirus, HTLV-1, HHV-8 and Borrelia burgdorferi. Such a physician might also be dismayed to learn that old enemies such as tuberculosis, malaria, diphtheria, West Nile virus, meningococcal meningitis, Yellow fever, and Dengue have become more (or rather less) prevalent due to antibiotic resistance and other factors. In addition, bioterrorism, long a theoretical possibility, is now part of today's reality and could result in the deliberate introduction of anthrax or other biological agents into the civilian population or the food supply. Thus, with the beginning of the new millennium, the medical profession, the veterinary profession, and the biomedical research establishment are faced with the triple-threat of emerging infectious diseases, reemerging infectious diseases, and bioterrorism. These topics are covered in this course, with an emphasis on student's participation in the discussion. Course open to graduate students only. Other students may petition the course director for permission to enroll. Emerging Infectious Diseases will cover emerging viral, bacterial and parasitic organisms, with lectures being given by faculty from the Schools of Medicine, Veterinary Medicine, Dental Medicine, and Arts and Sciences, and outside lecturers.

The course will start with basic and advanced concepts in physical chemistry and thermodynamics and introduce statistical mechanics as a tool to understand molecular interactions. The applications will be of relevance to bioengineering and biology disciplines. The course will not shy away from mathematical formulations and will stress the molecular perspective. This course explores physical biology of the cell across several length and timescales, while simultaneously emphasizing molecular specificity and clinical implications such as disease outcome or biomedical applications. The course emphasizes how the basic tools and insights of engineering, physics, chemistry, and mathematics can illuminate the study of molecular and cell biology to make predictive biomedical models and subject them to clinical validation. Drawing on key examples and seminal experiments from the current bioengineering literature, the course demonstrates how quantitative models can help refine our understanding of existing biological data and also be used to make useful clinical predictions. The course blends traditional models in cell biology with the quantitative approach typical in engineering, in order to introduce the student to both the possibilities and boundaries of the emerging field of physical systems biology. While teaching physical model building in cell biology through a practical, case-study approach, the course explores how quantitative modeling based on engineering principles can be used to build a more profound, intuitive understanding of cell biology.

Chemical Information for Biological Chemists,CHEM 6011,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course examines the structure and organization of the chemical literature in the field of biological chemistry and introduces techniques used to search this literature, focusing on the logic and thought processes necessary for effective information retrieval. The course takes an ""under the hood"" look at the organization and functionality of a variety of different databases and search systems, and, while learning information retrieval skills, students gradually become familiar with the structure of the chemical literature, the purposes of each genre, and the steps of the scientific publication process. Search skills are taught using a combination of lecture and laboratory activities, and students learn advanced text-based search techniques, protein and nucleotide sequence and structure similarity search strategies, basic substructure and reaction search strategies, and methods of retrieving property information and profiling substances by their properties. Students will also undertake a detailed examination protein and small molecule crystal structure databases. In addition to search skills, the students are exposed to strategies for choosing a publication venue; the use and limitations of citation information when evaluating authors, institutions, and journals; and the basic principles behind peer review. The semester closes with a brief introduction to personal data management and an in-depth discussion of the ethics surrounding scientific communication.

World Film History,CIMS 1004,Lecture,In Class,1,"Focusing on various cinematic movements, trends, and regional/national cinemas throughout film history, this course allows students to examine from various angles the connection between historical and cinematic developments. From early cinema, German Expressionism, the Soviet Montage, various new wave movements signaled by the Italian Neo-Realism, to contemporary movements such as Iranian New Wave, Taiwanese New Wave, and Korean New Wave, we will follow diverse cinematic trajectories from around the globe, as well as their interconnectedness. The goal is to cover a broad historical, cultural, thematic and stylistic range, but also to explore longer, pre-cinematic histories of regional and national traditions, and their connection to other artforms (opera, theater, painting) that had profound influence on the evolution of cinematic medium. The history of cinema will thus be approached as an intermedial history, which tends to blur the divides between old and new media, theatrical, painterly and photographic, foreign and national styles, conceiving of art in its hybrid and “impure” manifestation. We will also explore numerous ways the medium of film has played an active role in, narrated, and shaped history. Finally, we will examine how the concept of “world cinema history” gets shaped as a discursive construct, determining both major and minor cinematic flows. By tracing both dominant and peripheral trajectories and cinemas, we will see how “placing the film on the map” accounts for structural (in)equality and reveals gendered, racial, ethnic, economic and political nature of transnational processes in world cinema.",Varies by section,Not available,"CIMS History & Geography (ACHG)

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","When Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes in the 1893 short story “The Final Problem,” some readers donned black crepe for mourning. Others canceled their subscriptions to The Strand Magazine. Perhaps for the first time in history, fandom mobilized. And eventually, Conan Doyle brought Holmes back, writing 3 more collections of short stories and “The Hound of the Baskervilles.” In the interim, he permitted the actor William Gillette to revise the persona in a stage script, saying ""You may marry him, murder him, or do anything you like to him."" Since then, we have taken Conan Doyle at his word—revisiting and revising Sherlock in countless ways. This course will consider the phenomenon of Sherlock Holmes. We will begin with his antecedents in the detectives of the 19th century. Then, we’ll dive into Conan Doyle’s Sherlock, considering how the figure spoke to the late Victorian moment. Finally, we will explore Sherlock’s contemporary life in new novels, short stories, screenplays, tv series and computer games. In addition to a collection of the original Sherlock stories, our readings may include Edgar Allan Poe’s “Murders in the Rue Morgue,” Wilkie Collins’s The Moonstone, Jamyang Norbu’s The Mandala of Sherlock Holmes, Neil Gaiman’s “A Study in Emerald,” and Michael Chabon’s “The Final Solution.” Transmedia works to include the BBC’s Sherlock and CBS’s Elementary and a smattering of Holmes on film starting with the legendary Basil Rathbone.",Not available,"CIMS Non-American Cinema (ACMN)

Catastrophic flooding events are increasing in frequency, as are extreme droughts. Hurricane-related storm surges,tsunamis, and raging rivers have devastated regions on a local and global scale. In this seminar we will turn to the narratives and images that the human imagination has produced in response to the experience of overwhelming watery invasion, from Noah to New Orleans.

Introduction to Postcolonial Literatures,CIMS 1190,Lecture,In Class,1,"English is a global language with a distinctly imperial history, and this course serves as an essential introduction to literary works produced in or about the former European colonies. The focus will be poetry, film, fiction and non fiction and at least two geographic areas spanning the Americas, South Asia, the Caribbean and Africa as they reflect the impact of colonial rule on the cultural representations of identity, nationalism, race, class and gender. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","How does literature contend with the legacies of empire, specifically, modern European colonial rule in the 20th century? How have authors interpreted and responded to decolonisation, and relatedly, to emergent forms of neo-colonialism? How have these processes shaped contestations around issues of gender, race, class, caste and nation? This course will think through these concerns that continue to shape art, culture and society in the Global South today, long after the end of formal empire. We will analyze contemporary novels, short stories and essays addressing regions and contexts ranging from South Asia and West Africa to the Caribbean and post-war Britain. Texts will serve to introduce students to key authors and theoretical debates within the field of postcolonial literatures, and may include Chinua Achebe’s Thing Fall Apart, Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth. The course will also engage with critical perspectives on ‘post’-colonialism, and explore what postcolonial literatures can teach us about ongoing moves to ‘decolonise’ universities in the Global North and beyond. Assignments will include class participation, presentation, weekly posts and final paper.

Movie Musicals: From Oz to La La Land,CIMS 1276,Seminar,In Class,1,"The very first major sound film—The Jazz Singer, in 1927—featured not only speaking, but also singing. Audiences around the country hungrily consumed this new cinematic genre—one that was also strongly influenced by the stage musicals that were taking New York by storm. The synergy between Hollywood and Broadway was electric. Virtually every major composer and lyricist, including Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Rodgers and Hammerstein, worked both coasts. At the same time, the movies created new film celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Judy Garland, The Nicholas Brothers, and more. In the Depression 42nd Street, The Wizard of Oz, and Stormy Weather provided entertaining escapism—and sometimes a critical lens into reality. As time moved on movie musicals moved with them… and continue to do so. Jailhouse Rock, A Hard Day’s Night, Sparkle, The Who’s Tommy, Robert Altman’s Nashville, and Damien Chazelle’s La La Land are just a few of the films that reinvent and even subvert the genres, while showcasing stars from Elvis Presley to Tina Turner to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Movie Musicals will explore the development of this form and the artists who made it, including Busby Berkeley, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Bob Fosse, Baz Luhrmann… and of course, Walt Disney. The class will also present an international perspective: Bollywood, Nollywood, and the Scandinavian sensibility of Bjork and Lars von Trier’s Dancer in the Dark.",Not available,Not available,"CIMS History & Geography (ACHG)

Friendly Logics,CIS 6820,Lecture,In Class,1,"The use of logical formalisms in Computer Science is dominated by a fundamental conflict: expressiveness vs. algorithmic tractability. Database constraint logics, temporal logics and description logics are successful compromises in this conflict: (1) they are expressive enough for practical specifications in certain areas, and (2) there exist interesting algorithms for the automated use of these specifications. Interesting connections can be made between these logics because temporal and description logics are modal logics, which in turn can be seen, as can database constraint logics, as certain fragments of first-order logic. These connections might benefit research in databases, computer-aided verification and AI. Discussion includes other interesting connections, eg., with SLD-resolution, with constraint satisfaction problems, with finite model theory and with automata theory.","During Advance Registration and Open Enrollment this course is restricted to the graduate programs listed below.

The story of the Greeks, however, deserves a wider audience, because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, ""Know Thyself."" For us, that also means knowing the Greeks.

That, at least, is one version of the story. In truth, there are many stories that can be told of the period between the apogee of the Roman empire in the 2nd c. AD and the rise of Christianity and Islam and origins of the so-called Barbarian Kingdoms in the 7th and 8th centuries AD.

Ancient Women's Voices from Homer to Hadestown,CLST 1208,Seminar,In Class,1,"“We may call Eurydice forth from the world of the dead, but we cannot make her answer.” Such is the challenge, as described by Margaret Atwood, that faces a scholar of historically marginalized groups. Most of our knowledge about the lives of ancient Greek and Roman women comes from male sources, from which we imagine a female perspective. But what about when these figures have speaking roles? Are they still voiceless? This course provides an introductory survey of ancient Greek and Roman literary and dramatic texts which feature women as voiced (speaking) subjects. Readings will include excerpts in translation from Homeric epic, tragedy, Greek and Roman comedy, Vergil’s Aeneid, and Ovid. We will also consider the poetry of two ancient women, Sulpicia and Sappho. Can we assume that they represent more authentic experiences? Are these voices just as artificial and literary as their male-authored counterparts? We will also consider modern reimaginings of ancient women’s voices which offer new ways to reclaim, reframe, and problematize the ""Classical"" canon; these texts include Madeline Miller’s “Circe”, Nina Maclaughlin’s “Wake, Siren”, and the musical “Hadestown”. As we consider the voices of ancient figures, students will have the opportunity to develop their own through various critical speaking assignments.

We will also examine how his pupil, Plato, and subsequently Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems that address the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.

World Literature,CLST 1602,Seminar,In Class,1,"How do we think 'the world' as such? Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model, in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them, ""our world"" and ""theirs."" This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world, that are politically compelling, ethically important, and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. ""World literature"" here refers not merely to the usual definition of ""books written in places other than the US and Europe, ""but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born. And though, as we read and discuss our texts, we will glide about in space and time from the inner landscape of a private mind to the reaches of the farthest galaxies, knowledge of languages other than English will not be required, and neither will any prior familiary with the literary humanities. In the company of drunken kings, botanical witches, ambisexual alien lifeforms, and storytellers who've lost their voice, we will reflect on, and collectively navigate, our encounters with the faraway and the familiar--and thus train to think through the challenges of concepts such as translation, narrative, and ideology.

The Ancient Novel,CLST 3605,Seminar,In Class,1,"The ancient Greek and Roman novels include some of the most enjoyable and interesting literary works from antiquity. Ignored by ancient critics, they were until fairly recently dismissed by classical scholars as mere popular entertainment. But these narratives had an enormous influence on the later development of the novel, and their sophistication and playfulness, they often seem peculiarly modern--or even postmodern. They are also an important source for any understanding of ancient culture or society. In this course, we will discuss the social, religious and philosophical contexts for the ancient novel, and we will think about the relationship of the novel to other ancient genres, such as history and epic. Texts to be read will include Lucian's parodic science fiction story about a journey to the moon; Longus' touching pastoral romance about young love and sexual awakening; Heliodorus' gripping and exotic thriller about pirates and long-lost children; Apuleius' Golden Ass, which contains the story of Cupid and Psyche; and Petronius' Satyricon, a hilarious evocation of an orgiasic Roman banquet.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,SEAS Humanities (EUHS),TR 12pm-1:29pm (8/27 to 12/9),Massimo De Sanctis Mangelli,3.5,3.7,2.1,2.0,,,,[1.0]
Epic Tradition: Dido through the Ages,CLST 3708,Seminar,In Class,1,"This advanced seminar will examine the classical backgrounds of western medieval literature, in particular the reception of classical myth and epic in the literature of the Middle Ages. Different versions of the course will have different emphases on Greek or Latin backgrounds and on medieval literary genres. Major authors to be covered include Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and the Gawain-poet.","In his Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BCE), the Roman poet Virgil created the most enduring narrative of Dido, Queen of Carthage. Virgil invents the romance between Dido and the hero Aeneas, and has her kill herself when Aeneas leaves Carthage to carry out his imperial mission to Italy. But the figure of Dido quickly got away from Virgil’s conception to establish a literary and artistic life of its own, from Ovid’s treatment of Dido all the way to the twenty-first century. In this class we will trace the reception of Dido in poetry, philosophy, drama, art, opera, and dance through antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modernity. Dido is one of the most intriguing figures in literary history, on the one hand a feminist icon from the Middle Ages onward, and on the other hand a blank surface on which to test out different narratives of womanhood, gender roles, and political power. In this class we will study many cultural remakings of Dido, including: the poetry of Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and Christine de Pizan; the dramatic realization in Christopher Marlowe’s renaissance tragedy of Dido; Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas (1689) as well as other operas based on the Dido story; the regendering of Dido in Mark Morris’ dance adaptation (1989) of Purcell’s opera; and the Dido and Aeneas story in painting",Not available,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

Boethius from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern Period,CLST 7714,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar will explore the medieval and early modern reception of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, through literary imitations and translations, commentaries, and literary responses. To study the fortunes of the Consolation is to come to terms with one of the greatest informing influences on medieval and early modern European poetic thought. We will spend the first few weeks reading and digesting the Consolation itself, working between the Latin text and an English translation (probably using the Loeb edition). Knowledge of Latin is not required for the course, but the readings will provide ample opportunities for you to work on and with Latin as you wish. When we have read the Consolation we will explore its reception history. This will include medieval vernacular receptions (moving from early texts such as the Old English Boethius to its many appearances in Old French and Middle French, in Middle English especially in the form of Chaucer's Boece, and in any other language traditions that students want to cover); some of the remarkable commentaries on the text, and the later medieval literary apotheosis of the Consolation in Chaucer's Troilus and the ""Boethian lyrics,"" in Thomas Usk's Testament of Love, in Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes, and in early modern texts, including--spectacularly--the translation of the Consolation by Queen Elizabeth 1.

Study of a Theme in Global Literature,COML 0022,Lecture,In Class,1,"This introduction to literary study examines a compelling literary theme by attending to texts from around the globe. The theme's function within multiple historical and regional contexts, within literary history generally, and within contemporary culture, will all be emphasized. In presenting a range of materials and perspectives, this course is an ideal introduction to literary study. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","What is it like to leave home, and what does it mean to return? Rural-to-urban migration has been a defining experience of capitalist modernity since the Industrial Revolution, and in contrast to the city, the village is often viewed with nostalgia—as a place of origin, a site of belonging, or a point of departure. This course introduces students to literary study by examining representations of the village in texts from around the globe. The idea of “the global village” (a phrase coined by media theorist Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s) has long been invoked as a way of picturing the relationship between the local and the global in an interconnected world. Can fiction help us imagine what it means to be in community in our globalized present? And how might literary representations of the village—often envisioned as a place where older lifeways and deeply-rooted forms of community persist—help us to understand the uneven effects of globalization in the context of histories of race and empire? As we survey literature from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States, we will discover how literary methods can help us investigate these questions about belonging, resistance, tradition, and change together. Our readings may include novellas by George Eliot, short stories by John Berger and Annie Proulx, and novels by Chinua Achebe and NoViolet Bulawayo, as well as theory and criticism by Raymond Williams, Phil Neel, and others, and podcasts like NPR’s This American Life and Erica Heilman’s independently-produced Rumble Strip.

"Introduction to Psychoanalysis: History, Theory, Practice",COML 0052,Lecture,In Class,1,"The course will introduce students to the broad and ever-expanding spectrum of psychoanalytic ideas and techniques, through reading and discussion of major works by some of its most influential figures. We will also read some literary, historical, philosophical, and anthropological works that have special relevance to the psychoanalytic exploration of the human condition. In addition to the other requirements it satisfies, this course may also be counted toward completion of the Psychoanalytic Studies minor (http://web.sas.upenn.edu/psys/). See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","Psychoanalysis is not only a powerful therapeutic modality for numerous psychological stresses and disorders, it’s also a comprehensive way of looking at the world: a way of understanding 1) the roles that emotions play in all aspects of our lives; 2) the enormous influence of childhood experiences and early development on our later friendships, romantic relationships, sexual experiences, and other personal, familial, cultural, and professional bonds; and 3) the rich and complex meanings of our social and aesthetic experiences (e.g., going to college, playing a sport, reading a book, taking a vacation, having a baby or a dog, creating a company or a garden, etc.). The theory and practice of psychoanalysis, from Sigmund Freud to the present day, is based fundamentally on the importance of unconscious processes and the complex ways in which those processes affect our lived experience: in childhood development and family relationships; in our wishes, dreams, and fantasies; in our experiences of work, play, love, sex, trauma, and loss; and in our creative, spiritual, and political strivings. Because the course aims to link the academic and the clinical, it will be team-taught by an academic faculty member and a practicing psychoanalyst. The course will introduce students to the broad and ever-expanding spectrum of psychoanalytic ideas and techniques, through reading and discussion of major works by some of its most influential figures, such as Freud, Sándor Ferenczi, Melanie Klein, Heinz Kohut, Erik Erikson, D. W. Winnicott, Jacques Lacan, Wilfred Bion, John Bowlby, Stephen Mitchell, Jessica Benjamin, Nancy Chodorow, and Christopher Bollas. We will also read some literary, historical, philosophical, and anthropological works that have special relevance to the psychoanalytic exploration of the human condition. Indeed, the course will demonstrate how effective psychoanalytic ideas are in bridging a wide variety of disciplines in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences—including recent developments in neuropsychoanalysis. No prior knowledge of psychoanalysis is required, and interested students from all disciplines are warmly welcomed. The reading assignment for the second class meeting will be Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir, Are You My Mother?, if you want to get a head-start over Summer Break. Please note: in addition to the other requirements it satisfies, this course may also be counted toward completion of the Psychoanalytic Studies minor (http://web.sas.upenn.edu/psys/).

On the Stage and in the Streets: An Introduction to Performance Studies,COML 0104,Seminar,In Class,1,"What do Hamilton, RuPaul’s Drag Race, political protest, TikTok Ratatouille, and Queen Elizabeth’s funeral have in common? They all compose repertoires of performance. From artistic performances in theatres, galleries, and concert halls to an individual’s comportment in everyday life, to sporting events, celebrations, courtroom proceedings, performance studies explores what happens when embodied activities are repeatable and given to be seen. In this course we ask: what is performance? How do we describe, analyze, and interpret it? What do theatre and everyday life have in common? How does performance legitimize or challenge the exercise of power? How has social media shifted our understanding of the relationship of our daily lives to performance? How does culture shape what is considered to be performance and how it functions? What isn’t performance? Throughout the semester students will apply key readings in performance theory to case studies drawn from global repertoires of contemporary and historical performance. In addition to analyzing artistic performances, we will also consider sporting events, celebrations, political events, and the performance of everyday life. We will attend to the challenges provoked by performance’s embodied, ephemeral, affective, effective, relational, and contingent aspects. Coursework will include discussion posts, class facilitation, and the opportunity to choose between a research paper or creative project for the final assessment.",Not available,Not available,"ANTH Cultural and Linguistics (AACL)

Testimony: Life-writing as Dialogue (SNF Paideia Program Course),COML 0522,Seminar,In Class,1,"Testimony: Life-writing as Dialogue This hybrid literature/creative writing course centers on the genre of testimony as a form of life-writing and self-making that is fundamentally dialogic; that is, dependent on what Dori Laub calls “a listening other” to be fully realized. We will consider the concept and practice of testimony through three intersecting avenues. First, we will explore the multivalent critical theory of testimony, drawing from a range of disciplines including memory and trauma studies; human rights scholarship and activism; feminist philosophy; queer theory; disability studies; and more. Second, we will read and analyze contemporary testimony in a variety of genres, produced by people of diverse identities and experiences from around the world. Third, we will write and share in community our own series of short testimonies, learning and practicing critical skills for this particular form of dialogic practice that are transferable beyond the course, including: deep listening, self- and other-awareness, and the capacity to embrace the other’s enduring strangeness and incomprehensibility while still recognizing their humanity. Importantly, this is not a traditional writing workshop with peer review and revision cycles. While attention to craft is part of the testimonial process, the focus here is on sharing and receiving personal narratives without critique of craft. The course is open to all majors, and no particular “talent” or identity as a writer is required. The reading list will include contemporary (post-1945) narratives from Latin America/the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, Africa, and their U.S.-based diasporas as well as Native and Black U.S. writers.

Narrative Across Cultures,COML 1025,Lecture,In Class,1,"The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.","How does literature both connect cultures across time and space and speak about what is specific to each culture? In this course we will read several types of stories written in different periods and in different parts of the world, ranging from classical Greek and Sanskrit drama to modern African, European, American and Asian novels. Many of these texts are very well known, have had long afterlives, and have been adapted and rewritten in distant spaces and times. In some cases, we will engage with these retellings. Others directly embody the coming together or friction between cultures and peoples. By studying them, we can reflect on how literary texts reflect the cultures in which they were produced and have a capacity to travel across cultures.",Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

War and Representation,COML 1050,Seminar,In Class,1,"This class will explore complications of representing war in the 20th and 21st centuries. War poses problems of perception, knowledge, and language. The notional ""fog of war"" describes a disturbing discrepancy between agents and actions of war; the extreme nature of the violence of warfare tests the limits of cognition, emotion, and memory; war's traditional dependence on declaration is often warped by language games--""police action,"" ""military intervention,"" ""nation-building,"" or palpably unnamed and unacknowledged state violence. Faced with the radical uncertainty that forms of war bring, modern and contemporary authors have experimented in historically, geographically, experientially and artistically particular ways, forcing us to reconsider even seemingly basic definitions of what a war story can be. Where does a war narrative happen? On the battlefield, in the internment camp, in the suburbs, in the ocean, in the ruins of cities, in the bloodstream? Who narrates war? Soldiers, refugees, gossips, economists, witnesses, bureaucrats, survivors, children, journalists, descendants and inheritors of trauma, historians, those who were never there? How does literature respond to the rise of terrorist or ideology war, the philosophical and material consequences of biological and cyber wars, the role of the nuclear state? How does the problem of war and representation disturb the difference between fiction and non-fiction? How do utilitarian practices of representation--propaganda, nationalist messaging, memorialization, xenophobic depiction--affect the approaches we use to study art? Finally, is it possible to read a narrative barely touched or merely contextualized by war and attend to the question of war's shaping influence? The class will concentrate on literary objects--short stories, and graphic novels--as well as film and television. Students of every level and major are welcome in and encouraged to join this class, regardless of literary experience.",Not available,Not available,"ARTH Elective Major/Minor (AHAE)

Catastrophic flooding events are increasing in frequency, as are extreme droughts. Hurricane-related storm surges,tsunamis, and raging rivers have devastated regions on a local and global scale. In this seminar we will turn to the narratives and images that the human imagination has produced in response to the experience of overwhelming watery invasion, from Noah to New Orleans.

The focus will be poetry, film, fiction and non fiction and at least two geographic areas spanning the Americas, South Asia, the Caribbean and Africa as they reflect the impact of colonial rule on the cultural representations of identity, nationalism, race, class and gender.

How have these processes shaped contestations around issues of gender, race, class, caste and nation? This course will think through these concerns that continue to shape art, culture and society in the Global South today, long after the end of formal empire. We will analyze contemporary novels, short stories and essays addressing regions and contexts ranging from South Asia and West Africa to the Caribbean and post-war Britain. Texts will serve to introduce students to key authors and theoretical debates within the field of postcolonial literatures, and may include Chinua Achebe’s Thing Fall Apart, Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth. The course will also engage with critical perspectives on ‘post’-colonialism, and explore what postcolonial literatures can teach us about ongoing moves to ‘decolonise’ universities in the Global North and beyond.

World Literature,COML 1191,Seminar,In Class,1,"How do we think 'the world' as such? Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model, in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them, ""our world"" and ""theirs."" This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world, that are politically compelling, ethically important, and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. ""World literature"" here refers not merely to the usual definition of ""books written in places other than the US and Europe, ""but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born. And though, as we read and discuss our texts, we will glide about in space and time from the inner landscape of a private mind to the reaches of the farthest galaxies, knowledge of languages other than English will not be required, and neither will any prior familiary with the literary humanities. In the company of drunken kings, botanical witches, ambisexual alien lifeforms, and storytellers who've lost their voice, we will reflect on, and collectively navigate, our encounters with the faraway and the familiar--and thus train to think through the challenges of concepts such as translation, narrative, and ideology.

Belief and Unbelief in Modern Thought,COML 1250,Lecture,In Class,1,"""God is dead,"" declared Friedrich Nietzsche, ""and we have killed him."" Nietzche's words came as a climax of a longer history of criticism of, and dissent toward, the religious foundations of European society and politics. The critique of religion had vast implications for the meaning of human life, the nature of the person, and the conception of political and social existence. The course will explore the intensifying debate over religion in the intellectual history of Europe, reaching from the Renaissance, through the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, to the twentieth century. Rousseau, Voltaire, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. These thinkers allow us to trace the varieties of irreligious experience that have emerged in modern European thought and their implications for both historical and philosophical understanding. Rather than drawing a straight line from belief to non-belief, however, we will consider how religion may linger even in “secular” thought and culture; and we will develop something of an “encounter” between critics and defenders of religion, such as Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Buber, to see how religious discourse evolved in response to the challenges of skepticism.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Epic Tradition: Dido through the Ages,COML 2000,Seminar,In Class,1,"This advanced seminar will examine the classical backgrounds of western medieval literature, in particular the reception of classical myth and epic in the literature of the Middle Ages. Different versions of the course will have different emphases on Greek or Latin backgrounds and on medieval literary genres. Major authors to be covered include Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and the Gawain-poet.","In his Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BCE), the Roman poet Virgil created the most enduring narrative of Dido, Queen of Carthage. Virgil invents the romance between Dido and the hero Aeneas, and has her kill herself when Aeneas leaves Carthage to carry out his imperial mission to Italy. But the figure of Dido quickly got away from Virgil’s conception to establish a literary and artistic life of its own, from Ovid’s treatment of Dido all the way to the twenty-first century. In this class we will trace the reception of Dido in poetry, philosophy, drama, art, opera, and dance through antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modernity. Dido is one of the most intriguing figures in literary history, on the one hand a feminist icon from the Middle Ages onward, and on the other hand a blank surface on which to test out different narratives of womanhood, gender roles, and political power. In this class we will study many cultural remakings of Dido, including: the poetry of Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and Christine de Pizan; the dramatic realization in Christopher Marlowe’s renaissance tragedy of Dido; Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas (1689) as well as other operas based on the Dido story; the regendering of Dido in Mark Morris’ dance adaptation (1989) of Purcell’s opera; and the Dido and Aeneas story in painting",Not available,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

How do we live and write with a sense of response-ability to one another? How does our writing grapple with traumatic histories that continue to shape our world and who we are in it?

The Quest for a Universal Language,COML 6177,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar is an exploration in European intellectual history. It traces the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language among humanity. The tantalizing question of the possibility of such a language has been a vital and thought-provoking inquiry throughout human history. If recovered or invented, such a language has the potential to explain the origins, physical reality, and meaning of human experience, fostering universal understanding and world peace. Greek philosophers grappled with the capacity of names to correctly denote things. In Judaic and Christian traditions, the notion that the language spoken by Adam and Eve perfectly expressed the nature of the physical and metaphysical world captivated the minds of intellectuals for nearly two millennia. In defiance of the biblical myth of the confusion of languages and peoples at the Tower of Babel, they persistently endeavored to overcome divine punishment and rediscover the path to harmonious life. In the 19th century, Indo-Europeanist philologists perceived an avenue to explore the early stages of human development by reconstructing a proto-language. In the 20th century, romantic idealists like the inventor of Esperanto, Ludwik Zamenhof, constructed languages to further understanding among estranged nations. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the concept of a universal and perfect language has served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Today, this idea reverberates in theories of universal and generative grammars, in the approach to English as a global language, and in various attempts to devise artificial languages, including those intended for cosmic communication. Each week, we examine a particular period and a set of theories to explore universal language projects. But above all, at the core of the course lies an examination of what language is and how it is used in human society.",Not available,Not available,Not available,W 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),Julia Verkholantsev,,,,,"ENGL 7177,REES 6177",,,[1.0]

Boethius from Late Antiquity to the Early Modern Period,COML 7714,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar will explore the medieval and early modern reception of Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy, through literary imitations and translations, commentaries, and literary responses. To study the fortunes of the Consolation is to come to terms with one of the greatest informing influences on medieval and early modern European poetic thought. We will spend the first few weeks reading and digesting the Consolation itself, working between the Latin text and an English translation (probably using the Loeb edition). Knowledge of Latin is not required for the course, but the readings will provide ample opportunities for you to work on and with Latin as you wish. When we have read the Consolation we will explore its reception history. This will include medieval vernacular receptions (moving from early texts such as the Old English Boethius to its many appearances in Old French and Middle French, in Middle English especially in the form of Chaucer's Boece, and in any other language traditions that students want to cover); some of the remarkable commentaries on the text, and the later medieval literary apotheosis of the Consolation in Chaucer's Troilus and the ""Boethian lyrics,"" in Thomas Usk's Testament of Love, in Hoccleve's Regiment of Princes, and in early modern texts, including--spectacularly--the translation of the Consolation by Queen Elizabeth 1.

The purpose of the course is to gain insight into the ways in which gender, and its intersections with race, ethnicity, and class, is enacted, represented, and has an impact on cultural formations and communication. We will explore the socio-cultural mechanisms that shape our individual and collective notions of identity and essentially teach us what it means to be gendered masculine or feminine or align with other identifications. The media plays a major role in ""constructing"" gender, and popular views of what “appropriate” gendering is, in turn, shape how we communicate with each other. In examining cultural myths about gender as well as ongoing debates on gender construction, we will consider how gender is tied in with notions of power, identity, voice, and other defining identity categories (race, socio-economic status, sexuality, etc.) Throughout the course, we will examine a variety of media forms, from film to television to streaming platforms, as well as social media such as Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"COMM Advocacy & Activism (ACAA)

We examine how media institutions have played a role in propping up religious norms (both explicitly and implicitly) and the shaping of religious identities. This course looks at media as both enforcer and disruptor, as well as the ways in which religions have been challenged by those with media literacy and access. The evolution of religious practice and social norms can also be linked with technological innovations such as the mass distribution of Bibles in the 15th and 16th century thanks to the printing press, the rise of radio and television messiahs in the 20th century, and the individualization of religious practices through new apps.",Not available,Not available,"COMM Culture & Society (ACCS)

Re-Reading Canonic Texts in Media Research: Whose Canon? Which Texts? Why Now?,COMM 6500,Seminar,In Class,1,"Can a field of study as cross-disciplinary as media studies have a set of canonic texts? Should there be a canon? And if so, which texts and scholars would we regard as canonic to the field? In 2002, Elihu Katz et al. answered these questions with a book that mapped five schools of thought - Columbia, Frankfurt, Chicago, Toronto, and Birmingham (British Cultural Studies) - and explored how they came to define areas of research and shape the formation of distinct scholarly communities. Yet two decades ago, media and communication studies scholars were only beginning to take seriously the critiques and interventions being developed by scholars of race, gender, and postcoloniality. Now, students and scholars in media studies and other allied disciplines in the humanities and interpretive social sciences are grappling with the epistemic, ideological, and moral flaws of Eurocentric thought and in the process, re-vitalizing keywords, concepts, and theories. In this seminar, we will read and engage with canonic texts, delve into the historical conditions of the production of those texts, their afterlife and varied impact(s) on the field, and engage with critical responses that help recast their theoretical and analytic value for us today.

Economic development practice in the US is the result of decades of work from local and state governments and hybrid entities (community development institutions, hospitals, redevelopment authorities, commerce departments) attempting to make their respective places more “sticky” with respect to economic activity. While economic development may seem secondary, or worse, actively harmful in addressing some of the many pressing problems facing planners today, this course is designed to highlight why economic development remains central to questions about how regions can and should grow. The economic organization of our regions is a central actor in debates concerning global warming, displacement through gentrification or decline and social inequality.","**CPLN courses are initially limited to MCP students, but those outside the MCP program may request permission to register.

Downtown Development,CPLN 6420,Lecture,In Class,1,"Will downtowns recover? Is the office building obsolete? In the last decades of the 20th century America’s cities rebounded as downtowns diversified land-use, evolving from 9-5 office districts to 24-hour, mixed-use business, hospitality, retail, institutional and residential areas with an increasing number of well-managed parks and plazas. In many cities, downtown housing demand pushed prices beyond the range of many residents. The events of the last three years challenged many core assumptions and assets around which these places were built: public transit and the benefits of density, walkability and face-to-face interaction in the workplace, at conventions, in hotels, restaurants, cafes and public spaces. City Planning 6420 will focus on downtown recovery, reviewing the impact of three inter-related events: (1) the pandemic; (2) the duration of state and local government mandated shut-downs; and (3) civil unrest which led to rethinking and reformulating of public safety strategies in many cities. Responding to the pandemic required unprecedented actions by national governments, expedited production by pharmaceutical companies, well-designed and equitable distribution strategies. However, what happens on sidewalks, in stores and restaurants, in office buildings, universities and local health care institutions, in residential neighborhoods and in parks and public spaces is the result of local action: by government, business and civic groups and transit agencies.

It is intended as the first comprehensive exposure to the principles and processes of urban design for MCP students, and it is a required course for students in Urban Design concentration. This studio uses an incremental approach to explore contemporary practice of urban design. The semester consists of three sections: a site survey, an individual design project, and a group design project. The projects are organized around several themes associated with different scales and different dimensions of urban design: 1) street/block; 2) open space; 3) mobility and walkability; 4) urban form and ecology. This cross-scale method draws on essential theories of urbanism to investigate the interrelation between built environment and community development, and to address the issues of environmental and social sustainability of a postindustrial metropolis.",Not available,"Enrollment is limited to students with a program in Urban Design.

Taught by a practitioner who led the London Olympic Legacy Corporation, was Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development in Philadelphia and was the former planning director for Washington DC, the course will take a “hands-on” approach by combining case studies of major urban initiatives, field trips in Philadelphia to observe first hand how urban revitalization efforts have succeeded and been limited, and workshops where student teams will learn to design their own large-scale “city building” urban revitalization initiative. The goal of the course is for students to understand the forces that affect how cities and neighborhoods grow and change (economic, political, social, governance) and to be introduced to the comprehensive set of skills and perspectives essential to “building a city” such as infrastructure planning and finance; the organization of city planning and regulatory programs; urban and neighborhood governance and participation/ownership models; forms of public/private partnerships and tax incentive policies, among other topics. The course will examine major urban revitalization initiatives in recent 21st century history in North America and Europe to understand their effectiveness, such as: urban renewal; urban empowerment, enterprise and opportunity zones; Hope VI and the redevelopment of public housing; the London 2012 Olympics and mega sports events; urban waterfronts, such as the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative in Washington DC and the Delaware River waterfront in Philadelphia; the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative and recent Soda Tax in Philadelphia; the “smart city” proposed by Google on the Toronto waterfront; the rise of “innovation districts” and current initiatives proposed by President Biden’s Administration, such as the Bi-Partisan Infrastructure Act.",Not available,Enrollment limited to students in a Master of City Planning degree.,Not available,W 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),Andrew Altman,,,,,,,,[1.0]

In this course, we will identify the critical issues identified by the courts (and the critics) in light of the practical realities of capital litigation, and we will ask whether the efforts to address these issues have been successful. The class will use specific case examples to identify the critical points in a death penalty case- for example, the decision to designate a prosecution as ""capital"", the performance of defense counsel, the penalty decision, and the method of execution. These critical stages will provide a platform for discussing critical issues like the proper limits of discretion; bias; cruelty; and the decision to disqualify certain groups of people from capital punishment (the mentally disabled, minors). Students will be assigned readings from differnt kinds of sources. Cases from the Supreme Court will identify key issues and the efforts to address them under the law.

Forensic evidence, such as fingerprints, firearms, and hair, has been analyzed for hundreds of years to inform crime investigations and prosecutions. However, recent advances, especially the use of DNA technology, have revealed that a faulty forensic analyses may have contributed to wrongful convictions. These advances have demonstrated the potential danger of information and testimony derived from imperfect analysis, which can result not just in wrongful convictions but also in errors of impunity. In this course, students learn about the history of forensics, as well as about the recent advances that aim to improve current practices. It is an interdisciplinary course, but it focuses mostly on the statistical and scientific aspects of testing in forensics. Students discuss recent solutions that quantify the uncertainty, limitations, and errors associated with human factors, pattern evidence, and digital evidence.

"Art, Design and Digital Culture",DSGN 0010,Studio,In Class,1,"This course is an introduction to the fundamental perception, representation, aesthetics, and design that shape today's visual culture. It addresses the way artists and designers create images; design with analog and digital tools; communicate, exchange, and express meaning over a broad range of media; and find their voices within the fabric of contemporary art, design, and visual culture. Emphasis is placed on building an extended form of visual literacy by studying and making images using a variety of representation techniques; learning to organize and structure two-dimenstional and three-dimensional space, and designing with time-based and procedural media. Students learn to develop an individual style of idea-generation, experimentation, iteration, and critique as part of their creative and critical responses to visual culture.

Design 21: Design After the Digital,DSGN 0020,Seminar,In Class,1,"Last century, the digital revolution transformed every aspect of our lives. It shaped every design discipline and defined the ways we imagine and fabricate anything from images to everyday products to clothing, cars, buildings and and megacities. Today, design is going through other technical and conceptual revolutions. We design with biotechnologies, fall in love in Virtual Reality with AI bots, rent our cognitive labor through cryptocurriencies. Our creative capabilities, on the other hand, are bounded by a polluted, over-crowded, and resource-constrained planet that is suffering major income and educational inequality. Design After the Digital interrogates the role of design for this century. The seminar survyes the conceptual and technical developments in the past decade to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of design, science and technology. We will study how new design and fabrication methods shape what we eat, what we wear, how we form opinions and express ourselves.

By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times, we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions, artistic, architectural, and musical traditions, textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as ""Just-War,"" Women's Rights and Abortion. While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara, Japan or Vietnam, Laos.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism, reform and revolution, the Nationalist regime, Mao's China, the Cultural Revolution, and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism. We will conclude with a critical review of the concept of ""Greater China"" that takes into account Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora in order to attain a more comprehensive understanding of modern China, however defined, at the end of the last century.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Love and Loss in Japanese Literary Traditions: In Translation,EALC 1242,Lecture,In Class,1,"How do people make sense of the multiple experiences that the simple words ""love"" and ""loss"" imply? How do they express their thoughts and feelings to one another? In this course, we will explore some means Japanese culture has found to grapple with these events and sensations. We will also see how these culturally sanctioned frameworks have shaped the ways Japanese view love and loss. Our materials will sample the literary tradition of Japan from earliest times to the early modern and even modern periods. Close readings of a diverse group of texts, including poetry, narrative, theater, and the related arts of calligraphy, painting, and music will structure our inquiry. The class will take an expedition to nearby Woodlands Cemetery to experience poetry in nature. By the end of the course, you should be able to appreciate texts that differ slightly in their value systems, linguistic expressions, and aesthetic sensibilities from those that you may already know.

We will begin with the two most famous Daoist works--the Zhuangzi and the Daodejing (or Laozi). We will also survey other bio-spiritual practices, such as the meditational techniques of Inner Alchemy and the self-cultivation regimens known today as Qigong and Tai-chi, as well as the theological and ritual foundations of organized Daoist lineages, many of which are still alive across East Asia. We will conclude with a critical review of the twentieth-century reinvention of ""Daoism,"" the scientization of Inner Alchemy, and the new classification of ""religious"" versus ""philosophical Daoism."" While familiarizing ourselves with the key concepts, practices, and organizations developed in the history of Daoism, this course emphasizes the specific socio-political context of each of them. Throughout the course, we will think critically about the label of ""Daoist"" (as well as ""Confucian"" and ""Buddhist"") in Chinese history and in modern scholarship.

Cities in Chinese History,EALC 2722,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar will study the development of Chinese cities over the past two millennia with respect to their spatial structure, social constitution, economic system, political functions, and cultural representation (including cityscape paintings, maps, and films).As China transitioned from a collection of city-states to a united empire to nation state, Chinese urbanism underwent transformations as drastic as those of the country itself. Cities, which serve as a critical mechanism for the operation of a vast agrarian empire/nation like China , offer a unique vantage point for us to observe and analyze the continuities and discontinuities between dynastic empires as well as the radical transition from empire to modern nation state. Topics include: the city-state system in ancient China; the creation and evolution of imperial capitals; the medieval urban revolution and the subsequent collapse of classic city plans; the development of urban public sphere/public space in late imperial China; the rise of commercial power in urban politics; the negotiation of urban class and gender relations via cultural consumption; the role of cities in the building of a modern Chinese nation state; the anti-city experiment under the communist regime; urban citizenship in the reform era; as well as the expanding urbanization and shifting urbanism of Greater China as reflected in cinematic representations of Shanghai, Hongkong, and Taipei.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"EALC Chinese and Inner Asia (AEAN)

Rivers in a Changing World,EAS 2020,Lecture,In Class,1,"Like many cities, Philadelphia was built and developed around rivers. These rivers historically provided drinking water, food, power, trade routes, and recreation. Human development, however, has led to flooding, erosion and pollution; these factors degrade the ability of rivers to provide ecological habitat, and ultimately may turn rivers from a resource into a hazard. Unfortunately, lower income neighborhoods often bear the brunt of these negative impacts. In the face of climate change, extreme floods and erosion are only getting worse. The news, however, is not all bad. With improving understanding of environmental science and engineering, techniques that counteract flooding and clean up waterways are being developed and deployed. Armed with knowledge of science, citizens can become agents of change in their communities. It is in this context that we propose a partnership among Sayre High School, Penn’s Netter Center, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, to develop an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course on “Rivers in a changing world”. We seek to take advantage of the newly refurbished Cobbs Creek Environmental Center, which will host a brand new environmental laboratory space. A Project for Progress award from Penn has provided additional funding for state of the art equipment, including a “stream table”; this is a laboratory river that allows interactive and discovery-driven learning. The unique setting of an environmental river laboratory that is just steps from a natural river (Cobbs Creek), and close to Sayre High School, presents a special opportunity for meaningful hands-on learning of Sayre students in collaboration with Penn undergraduates. Course material will be co-developed between Sayre and Penn participants, so that learning modules in the laboratory and natural river are connected to curriculum objectives. Sayre is a Netter Center university-assisted community school and Mr. Smith has worked with Penn students in his classrooms for many years. He has a desire to bring students to the Cobbs Creek Environmental Education Center for hands-on real world environmental education and problem solving. Therefore, this is an ideal partnership for this ABCS course. Also, there is also a need for more climate-related classes at Penn and this course addresses that need.",Not available,Not available,"Academically Based Community Service Courses (UNAS)

The course intends to improve the ability of engineers and other technology disciplines to gain more support more quickly for projects, researc product and services development, and marketing. For those wanting to be entrepreneurs o r intrapreneurs, the course is designed essentially to find the most value possible in starting up and running companies. Based on Professor Diamond's innovative and renowned model of negotiation, it is intended to assist those for whom technical expertise is not enough to persuade others, internally and externally, to provide resources, promotions and project approvals; or to resolve disputes, solve problems and gain more opportunities. Rejecting the 40-year-old notions of power, leverage and logic, the course focuses on persuasion by making better human connections, uncovering perceptions and emotions, and structuring agreements to be both collaborative and fair. This course is entrepreneurial in nature and can provide many times more value than traditional persuasion. The Getting More book has sold more than 1 million copies around the world and is also used by universities, corporations (Google), and U.S. Special Operations (SEALs, Green Berets, Special Forces, Marines) to save lives and reduce conflict.

Enrollment is limited to 12 previously selected 12 EENT Fellows. Prior to taking this course, EENT Fellows will have completed EAS5410 Engineering Entrepreneurship Fellows I in the spring semester and will have been immersed in a hands-on internship at a high-growth technology startup company in the summer semester. During this summer internship, Fellows will have: (i) supported significant strategic initiatives at their startup; (ii) had one-on-one contact with top-level company leaders; (iii) kept and shared structured journals of their experiences; and (iv) hosted visits, in-person or remotely, of other Fellows to their startup companies to share experiences. Throughout the 12-month Program, the Fellows will benefit from personal one-on-one mentoring by distinguished alumni, venture executives and investors. The summer journal will be a pre-requisite assignment for EAS5430. It will include the Fellows’ observations and analysis of specific assignment topics within their respective companies which will, in turn, be shared and commented on by the other Fellows. Assigned topics will include origins of the startup’s innovative technology, intellectual property considerations, product-market fit, marketing strategy, business model, venture financing, management, handling adversity, scaling, culture, values, and principled leadership. Journals will be maintained online allowing Fellows the opportunity to share and reflect on their own and their classmates’ summer experiences with the objectives of: (a) comparing and discussing internship experiences; (b) exploring the elements of entrepreneurship; (c) compiling information useful for debriefing and case studies in EAS5430 in the fall; and (d) connecting the theory of EAS5410 with the realities of startups. In EAS5430 Fellows will debrief their summer internship experiences with each other and faculty. Drawing from knowledge, skills and frameworks acquired in EAS5410, as well as guidance from their mentors and their summer internship journal entries, each Fellow will prepare and deliver a presentation of their experience. Executive leaders from each startup will be invited as guest speakers to present their perspective on the creation and growth of their respective companies. Each Fellow will also prepare and present a case study focused on their observation and/or involvement in a significant event, problem, or achievement of the company. Throughout EAS5430, the pedagogic approach will involve lectures, case discussions, assigned readings, and individual and guest presentations. Feedback on verbal presentation skills will also be provided as in EAS5410. Intended Learning Outcomes: Upon course completion, students will be equipped with knowledge and skills to: 1) Connect the academic theory of entrepreneurship with the realities of startup ventures. 2) Select an appropriate intellectual property strategy for a technology-based product in a startup environment. 3) Achieve product-market fit by shaping an innovative technology-driven device into a market-driven product. 4) Identify and validate target customer segment(s) and develop effective marketing, sales, and distribution plans. 5) Develop a business model and competitive strategy for establishing a defensible position within an industry. 6) Determine the capital requirements for a startup venture including the amount, timing, and sources of financing, and be knowledgeable of the terms, conditions, and negotiability of venture capital term sheets. 7) Understand a company’s financial statements and assess key metrics of financial health. 8) Understand the regulatory approval process for medical devices and drugs including its phases, timing, costs, and operational implications for an entrepreneurial startup venture. 9) Recruit and lead an effective, principled team of co-workers an",Not available,Enrollment in this course is restricted.

In such situations, the outcome of your actions depends also on the actions of others. When making your choice, you have to think what the others will choose, who in turn are thinking what you will be choosing, and so on. Game Theory offers several concepts and insights for understanding such situations, and for making better strategic choices. This course will introduce and develop some basic ideas from game theory, using illustrations, applications, and cases drawn from business, economics, politics, sports, and even fiction and movies. Some interactive games will be played in class. There will be little formal theory, and the only pre-requisites are some high-school algebra and having taken Econ 1. However, general numeracy (facility interpreting and doing numerical graphs, tables, and arithmetic calculations) is very important.

Economics and Theories of Fairness,ECON 0460,Lecture,In Class,1,"Free markets excel at producing wealth, but seem to do so at the cost of economic inequality. Is this inequality unjust? Is it a problem economics and public policy should solve? Liberal democracies have traditionally had the protection of private property as a core mandate. But they also have varying degrees of redistribution in order to fund social welfare systems. How can we reconcile these objectives which seem to conflict? Is the protection of individual rights more important than the promotion of the greatest good for all? To what extent can personal liberty and the common good be reconciled? In this course, we will use the philosophical concept of justice to address these and other related questions. We will draw from the economic history, political theory, and the history of philosophy in order to acquire a framework for understanding the concepts of justice, liberty, rights, and equality. We shall then apply this historical and conceptual framework to discussion topics and case studies drawn from present day economics and contemporary social issues. In this way, we shall come to understand economics as more than a social science of laws and theorems. Instead we shall see how economics as an applied science influences the well-being of the whole of society.",Not available,Not available,"PHIL Phil Related MPP (APLR)

Foundations of Market Economies,ECON 4610,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will study the historical and intellectual forces behind the appearance of market economies on the world stage. The voyages of exploration undertaken by Europeans in the 15th and 16th century created, in just a few decades, a global economy. By 1600, silver from Mexico was exchanged in Manila for ceramics made in Nanjing (China). After a long trip through the Pacific, Mexico, and the Atlantic, the ceramics ended up in the tables of prosperous merchants in Bruges (modern day Belgium). How did this integrated global economy appear? How did global interconnections over the centuries shap our current world? How did markets emerge and influence these interconnections? Who were the winners of globalization? And who were the losers? How did economists, political scientists, and others think about the strengths and weakness of market economies? This course will explore these questions and the role that markets have played in it from the late 15th century to the present. Even if the economic theory will structure much of the discussion, insights from intellectual history, cultural history, microhistory, legal history, and institutional history will help to frame the main narrative. The course will be, as well, truly global. First, beyond the traditional focus of economic history courses on Europe and the Americas, particular attention will be devoted to Africa and Asia. Second, the priority will be to highlight the interconnections between the different regions and to understand how the people living in them negotiated the opportunities and tensions created by the economic transformations triggered by globalization and how they conceptualized the changing lives around them. Finally, the class will highlight how diverse intellectual traditions handled the challenges presented by historical change.",Not available,Students with a semester level of Freshman may not enroll.,"HIST Concentration in Economic History Related (AHEC)

This course will 1) explore fundamental principles underlying mindfulness, 2) the scientific data on its effects, and 3) the ways in which mindfulness is being applied to clinical and educational settings to support healthy human development. Contemplative practices include all forms of meditation, including contemplative dimensions of yoga, tai chi, qigong and other mind-body wellness activities. By far the most well known contemplative practice in the U.S. today is ""mindfulness."" Mindfulness meditation was introduced into clinical medicine in the 1980's in the form of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) by Jon Kabat-Zinn and his colleagues at U Mass; since that time it has had a significant impact on psychoneuroimmunology, clinical medicine, and especially behavioral medicine. Both psychological theory and practice have slowly been transformed by new findings emerging from mindfulness research. Brain imaging studies of persons engaged in meditation suggest that focused mental activities can actually change cerebral blood flow (Newberg et al 2010), brain morphology and neural circuitry, in addition to strengthening the immune system (Davidson et al 2003) and improving attention skills (Jha et al 2007). MBSR has been repeatedly documented to be effective in treating mental health problems, particularly depression and anxiety, in numerous adult populations (Goyal et al 2014). Now, researchers are testing MBSR and other mindfulness approaches in children and adolescents as both a way to treat social-emotional dysfunction as well as to promote health and enhance",Not available,Not available,"Designated SNF Paideia Program Course (UNPP)

"Outside the School Box: History, Policy and Alternatives",EDUC 5151,Seminar,In Class,1,"So, we all know that we've been educated by many factors -- schools, family, media, community organizations, religious institutions, employers, health agencies, social movements, and so on. Yet when we speak about ""education,"" we often collapse it instantly into ""schooling."" What if we didn't? This discussion-based course takes on that challenge. What if we look at education as it actually happens, in ways inclusive of but reaching well beyond schooling? What if we step outside the school box into which we're often putting education? What are the implications for how we think about education, about particular configurations of educating institutions in any current educational ecosystem, about public and private purposes, and about what it means to be a professional in education? How do we wrap our arms around ""education"" when it suddenly encompasses, well, all of those entities that intentionally educate us? Viewing education more broadly than schooling, we will pursue a conversation between historical and current challenges, toward understanding the present implications -- for practice, for policy, for professions -- if we were to make such a basic shift conceptually and operationally.

In this course, we will actively engage in this debate through a survey of the development literature in the field of education. We will examine theoretical frameworks and historical perspectives that will allow us to develop a better understanding of what is meant by ""development"" as well as recognize how these concepts relate to basic educational planning and practice in various international contexts.  Prior graduate work in related areas recommended. The course will work from primary and secondary materials on theories, research, and applications used to promote global development and basic education. Some programs are carried out by multinational/bilateral agencies such as World Bank, Unicef, UNESCO, and USAID, while others are undertaken by intermediary organizations (such as NGOs and universities) and local organizations or individual specialists. Issues include a range of social, economic and political obstacles to the provision of quality education.

"Stereotype Threat, Impostor Phenomenon, and African Americans",EDUC 5538,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course critically examines stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon as they relate to African Americans. Both stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon negatively affect African Americans. The apprehension experienced by African Americans that they might behave in a manner that confirms an existing negative cultural stereotype is stereotype threat, which usually results in reduced effectiveness in African Americans' performance. Stereotype threat is linked with impostor phenomenon. Impostor phenomenon is an internal experience of intellectual phoniness in authentically talented individuals, in which they doubt their accomplishments and fear being exposed as a fraud. While stereotype threat relies on broad generalization, the impostor phenomenon describes feelings of personal inadequacy, especially in high-achieving African Americans. This course will explore the evolving meanings connected to both stereotype threat and impostor phenomenon in relation to African Americans.",No restrictions on graduate student enrollment.

In many ways, examining the issues surrounding autism spectrum disorders provides insights into special needs, neurodiversity, and disability rights in general. This course focuses on the social, linguistic, cognitive, educational, and disability rights aspects of autism, including implications for treatment, accommodation, and counseling. We examine the challenges that individuals with autism have in acquiring language, in deducing the perspectives of other people (Theory of Mind), in engaging in certain types of cognitive tasks, and in having their voices heard by others. We examine, as well, the unusual talents and intellectual strengths that many ASD individuals exhibit. Students interested in working with individuals on the autism spectrum in educational and counseling settings will gain insight into: • How autism spectrum disorders affect the acquisition of social and academic skills • The availability and efficacy of different types of interventions and accommodations • Issues relating to neurodiversity and disability rights • Strategies for guiding students with autism spectrum disorders through K12 schools and beyond",No restrictions on graduate student enrollment.

It is an interdisciplinary field consisting of researchers who study among other things, cognition, science and math education, language literacy, anthropological and sociological perspectives, computer science, and educational psychology. Learning scientists study learning as it happens in real world contexts and design resources and environments to improve learning in those contexts. This can happen in school, in informal places, at work, and online. Although the learning sciences is continually evolving, what remains true of the tenets of this educational field is that learning happens through mediated processes that most often require collaboration with others whereby learning is inextricably linked to context and culture.

"Literacy Research, Theory, and Practice",EDUC 6306,Seminar,In Class,1,"This graduate seminar is a capstone course in the Reading, Writing, and Literacy master's program, designed to help students develop understandings about key theoretical underpinnings of literacy research. As a foundational course, the seminar will explore how literacy has been conceptualized over time and across disciplines, examining how literacy has functioned as a touchstone issue in policy and practice as people debate what 'counts' as literacy. While we explore these debates, we focus particularly on contemporary literacy theories that understand literacy to be multiple, ideological, and socially situated - practices grounded in specific contexts that are fundamentally linked to broader social, cultural, and political power structures. Inquiry sits at the heart of the course, with students developing an online learning portfolio centered around their individual research, course readings, and prior experiences. Students will reflect on their RWL program of study, write about conceptual territories at the heart of the program, and curate materials from the semester and their program of study to demonstrate their learning and development over time. Students will work with coaches as well as engage in a workshop learning environment, culminating in an online learning portfolio and presentation to RWL faculty.",For RWL students only.

Teaching English/Language and Literacy in Middle and Secondary Schools,EDUC 6329,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course is a collaborative inquiry into the dynamic concept of adolescent literacy and its potential as an organizing construct for improving teaching and learning. It provides opportunities to investigate a variety of resources including our own histories as well as a range of print, digital and visual texts and to conduct fieldwork in various middle and secondary school classrooms where youth are being positioned (and positioning themselves) as literacy learners and literacy is being defined, performed, practiced, interrogated, and interpreted, within and beyond the school curricula. By engaging with youth, in various texts and contexts and for a range of purposes, participants will try to make sense of how adolescents negotiate their worlds, in school and out. The approach to literacy is interdisciplinary, drawing from the domains of literature, composition, linguistics, curriculum theory, anthropology and psychology and from theory, research and practice of both university-based and school-based teachers, writers and researchers. The intent is to pose and refine questions about what it means to teach literacy in ways that take seriously what youth bring to school as their own knowledge and passions, cultural and linguistic resources.",For RWL students only.

Coursework is built around the project cycle and will acquaint you with current approaches to development and accompanying tools employed by a variety of international development organizations. Specifically, you will gain skills to determine how to gather adequate information, interpret information and put this information into clear and helpful frameworks for formulating recommendations for action. To learn these skills, you will work in small groups on a technical proposal throughout the semester. Throughout the semester, we will seek a more nuanced understanding of the general context and the role of institutions in global development work, while being aware of local realities and ethical issues that make development as contested locally as it is at national and global levels. Development from this perspective is not primarily a technical enterprise, although it does require skill with ""techniques'. Rather it involves a process of heralding the best available information to facilitate the mobilization of resources and people to engender development - a development process whose focus is broadening people's capacities, opportunities, choices, and access to social justice.",For IEDP students only.

"Modeling Leadership Resilience through Chaos, Crisis, Calamity, Calumny, and Catastrophe",EDUC 7849,Seminar,In Class,1,"Institutions, agencies, NGOs, industries, and educational systems are vulnerable to disruptions that can escalate rapidly to truly catastrophic conditions. Local, national, and international incidents -- including those caused by natural disasters, human behavior, infrastructure failures, and acts of terror -- can pose serious threats to the health and wellness of individuals and cohort groups of community members and to the normative functioning of institutional entities. These conditions, also, within the heightened immediacy of globally interconnected electronic communications modalities, must be optimally ameliorated under compressed time pressures amidst highly volatile circumstances that can be peopled with disaffected and/or seditious stakeholders. In response to these potential threats, many entities, institutions, and educational systems have pro-actively developed strategic risk-remediation and crisis response frameworks that they attempt to implement consistently, effectively, and efficiently to maintain mission-critical functions and to restore institutional stasis after a disruption. Leaders who most consistently foment institutional resilience are those who are: (a) strategically nimble, decisive, purposeful, and optimistic; and, therefore (b) most adept at meeting the vagaries of institutional crises using critical incident response and recovery models that are optimally crafted to use the strengths of their individual and leadership team’s styles and institutional culture. The core goal of the Modeling Resilient Leadership through Crisis, Calamity, Calumny, and Catastrophe course is to acquaint students with categories of crises endemic to institutions, agencies, and systems; to help them understand the importance of crisis mitigation advance planning including the elements of a crisis management plan and the value of “tabletop” practice; to increase their knowledge of how leadership styles and characteristics contribute to leadership resilience through institutional crises, and to survey institutional crisis response variables including: threat and vulnerability analysis, crisis communications, stakeholders, and audiences.",For HED students only.

Study of a Theme in Global Literature,ENGL 0022,Lecture,In Class,1,"This introduction to literary study examines a compelling literary theme by attending to texts from around the globe. The theme's function within multiple historical and regional contexts, within literary history generally, and within contemporary culture, will all be emphasized. In presenting a range of materials and perspectives, this course is an ideal introduction to literary study. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","What is it like to leave home, and what does it mean to return? Rural-to-urban migration has been a defining experience of capitalist modernity since the Industrial Revolution, and in contrast to the city, the village is often viewed with nostalgia—as a place of origin, a site of belonging, or a point of departure. This course introduces students to literary study by examining representations of the village in texts from around the globe. The idea of “the global village” (a phrase coined by media theorist Marshall McLuhan in the 1960s) has long been invoked as a way of picturing the relationship between the local and the global in an interconnected world. Can fiction help us imagine what it means to be in community in our globalized present? And how might literary representations of the village—often envisioned as a place where older lifeways and deeply-rooted forms of community persist—help us to understand the uneven effects of globalization in the context of histories of race and empire? As we survey literature from Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States, we will discover how literary methods can help us investigate these questions about belonging, resistance, tradition, and change together. Our readings may include novellas by George Eliot, short stories by John Berger and Annie Proulx, and novels by Chinua Achebe and NoViolet Bulawayo, as well as theory and criticism by Raymond Williams, Phil Neel, and others, and podcasts like NPR’s This American Life and Erica Heilman’s independently-produced Rumble Strip. Assignments will include reading responses, an in-class presentation, and the choice of writing a research paper or recording a scripted podcast as a final project.///////.

The course will introduce you to the manifold connections between theories of world literature and fields such as globalization studies, translation studies, comparative literature, and postcolonial studies. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","This course will introduce you to the great variety of narrative forms and themes in autobiographical literature from a wide range of cultural and national traditions. As a course on a major narrative genre, it will give you a grounding in the fundamentals of genre- and narrative-theory and criticism. And, as a course on world literature, it will introduce you to the principles and theories of comparativism, as well as contemporary debates regarding the regional, the national, and the global in literary studies. Our focus will be on “modern” autobiography, from the late 18th century to the present day, with particular emphasis on 20th- and 21st-century autobiographical writing, from many different parts of the world. All works—many of them in translation—will be read in English, which means we’ll be examining the role of the English language in shaping different conceptions of “world literature.” Representative authors and locales include: Alison Bechdel (U.S.), Nirad Chaudhuri (India), Mohamed Choukri (Morocco), J. M.

Narrative Across Cultures,ENGL 0039,Lecture,In Class,1,"The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.","How does literature both connect cultures across time and space and speak about what is specific to each culture? In this course we will read several types of stories written in different periods and in different parts of the world, ranging from classical Greek and Sanskrit drama to modern African, European, American and Asian novels. Many of these texts are very well known, have had long afterlives, and have been adapted and rewritten in distant spaces and times. In some cases, we will engage with these retellings. Others directly embody the coming together or friction between cultures and peoples. By studying them, we can reflect on how literary texts reflect the cultures in which they were produced and have a capacity to travel across cultures.",Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

"Introduction to Psychoanalysis: History, Theory, Practice",ENGL 0052,Lecture,In Class,1,"The course will introduce students to the broad and ever-expanding spectrum of psychoanalytic ideas and techniques, through reading and discussion of major works by some of its most influential figures. We will also read some literary, historical, philosophical, and anthropological works that have special relevance to the psychoanalytic exploration of the human condition. In addition to the other requirements it satisfies, this course may also be counted toward completion of the Psychoanalytic Studies minor (http://web.sas.upenn.edu/psys/). See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","Psychoanalysis is not only a powerful therapeutic modality for numerous psychological stresses and disorders, it’s also a comprehensive way of looking at the world: a way of understanding 1) the roles that emotions play in all aspects of our lives; 2) the enormous influence of childhood experiences and early development on our later friendships, romantic relationships, sexual experiences, and other personal, familial, cultural, and professional bonds; and 3) the rich and complex meanings of our social and aesthetic experiences (e.g., going to college, playing a sport, reading a book, taking a vacation, having a baby or a dog, creating a company or a garden, etc.). The theory and practice of psychoanalysis, from Sigmund Freud to the present day, is based fundamentally on the importance of unconscious processes and the complex ways in which those processes affect our lived experience: in childhood development and family relationships; in our wishes, dreams, and fantasies; in our experiences of work, play, love, sex, trauma, and loss; and in our creative, spiritual, and political strivings. Because the course aims to link the academic and the clinical, it will be team-taught by an academic faculty member and a practicing psychoanalyst. The course will introduce students to the broad and ever-expanding spectrum of psychoanalytic ideas and techniques, through reading and discussion of major works by some of its most influential figures, such as Freud, Sándor Ferenczi, Melanie Klein, Heinz Kohut, Erik Erikson, D. W. Winnicott, Jacques Lacan, Wilfred Bion, John Bowlby, Stephen Mitchell, Jessica Benjamin, Nancy Chodorow, and Christopher Bollas. We will also read some literary, historical, philosophical, and anthropological works that have special relevance to the psychoanalytic exploration of the human condition. Indeed, the course will demonstrate how effective psychoanalytic ideas are in bridging a wide variety of disciplines in the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences—including recent developments in neuropsychoanalysis. No prior knowledge of psychoanalysis is required, and interested students from all disciplines are warmly welcomed. The reading assignment for the second class meeting will be Alison Bechdel’s graphic memoir, Are You My Mother?, if you want to get a head-start over Summer Break. Please note: in addition to the other requirements it satisfies, this course may also be counted toward completion of the Psychoanalytic Studies minor (http://web.sas.upenn.edu/psys/).

First Year Seminar: The Short Story Cycle,ENGL 0376,Seminar,In Class,1,"This First Year Seminar examines some of the greatest short-stories from the 19th and 20th centuries, with special attention to writing of the modern period, vivid with new experiences and alive with stylistic experimentation. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","Edgar Allan Poe established the modern short story as a brief narrative designed to thrill its reader with sensational action and a candid view of the human psyche's murky underside. Poe's multiple legacies (gothic fiction, ghost story, whodunit, medical fantasy, adventure tale) were extended and developed in the nineteenth century, then elevated by modernist writers into the basis for a self-consciously artistic form that blends outward adventure with psychological insight, climax with anti-climax -- while keeping the action within a single, compact frame. The first half of the twentieth-century saw some of the greatest short-story writing of the modern period, vivid with new experiences and alive with stylistic experimentation. In this seminar, we will read stories and story-sequences by James Joyce, William Faulkner, Franz Kafka, Katherine Mansfield, Sherwood Anderson, and Jean Rhys. We begin with detective fiction (Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes tales) and modernist precursors (Poe and Anton Chekhov); we will end with the resurgence of moral realism after 1950, studying a writer concerned with fundamental questions of good and evil (Flannery O'Connor). Along the way, we will ask what makes memorable stories tick, how story-sequences compare to novels, and why the novel (a genre in which many of our writers were accomplished experts) came in the long run to eclipse short stories in the world of fiction. In addition to addressing the historical and literary questions outlined above, the course is designed to introduce the methods and purposes of literary studies as an academic discipline, to hone your critical thinking skills, and to refine the expression of your thought in both persuasive writing and informal discussion.",Enrollment limited to students with the Penn Classification Freshman attribute.,"College-Sector - Arts & Letters (AUAL)

Virginia Woolf,ENGL 0506,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course explores an aspect of literary modernism intensively, featuring the avant-garde, the politics of modernism, and its role in shaping poetry, music, and the visual arts. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","In 1924, a century ago, Virginia Woolf was a forty-two-year-old writer with hundreds of reviews and essays, a dozen short stories, and three novels to her name. She was hard at work on her fourth novel, /Mrs. Dalloway/, which, when it was published the following year, would firmly establish her literary reputation and propel her to celebrity. Woolf is widely recognized today as one of the twentieth century’s most innovative, prolific, and versatile writers—a devout diarist and correspondent who also penned several groundbreaking memoirs and influential long-form essays, and nine novels that are among the most beloved, widely adapted, and closely studied in the English language. This Benjamin Franklin Seminar offers students a semester-long immersion in Woolf’s life and writings while also attending closely to the historical contexts of both. It introduces students, in addition, to the large and rapidly growing body of scholarship on Woolf through two major writing assignments: a book review of a recent scholarly monograph or edition; and a research paper on some focused topic, theme, or question. Both majors and non-majors should emerge from the course better able to learn their way around a given cultural figure’s life and oeuvre. And they should be equipped to connect such a figure to contemporary individuals, communities, and historical energies and to navigate her cultural legacy and scholarly archive in pursuit of their own research questions. As a way of delving into Woolf’s legacy, we will also read two recent works: ‘/Of One Woman or So/ by Olivia N’Gowfri,’ a novella that Kabe Wilson created in 2014 by resequencing every word in Woolf’s /A Room of One’s Own/; and /LOTE/, Shola von Reinhold’s 2020 novel about the “Bright Young Things” of the wider Bloomsbury circle, in which dark academia meets Black trans joy.",Enrollment in this course is restricted.

In doing so, we will recognize the continuing role of these events and experiences in shaping the cultural, social, and political realities of contemporary South Asia (including the creation of Bangladesh in 1972). We will also learn about the crucial role played by literary and creative texts in making available to us the full dimensions of human tragedy, especially those precipitated when the imperatives of nation-formation redefine the lives of individuals or of sub-national communities.",Not available,"Ben Franklin Seminars (UNBF)

"Black Style: Fashions, Fictions, and Films of the 1920s",ENGL 0525,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course will explore literature, art, film, and politics of the 1920s Harlem Renaissance, also known as the New Negro Movement. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.","The 1920s Harlem Renaissance, also known as the New Negro Movement, was driven by the belief that black people must be the ones to represent black people in literature, art, and politics. There was, however, no consensus about what these representations should look like or whether they should please white or black audiences—and there was certainly no consensus about what it meant to be black or to have black style. Using fashion (an aesthetic, commodity, and practice) as a lens, we will examine the lively debates about the relationship between race and representation in print and on film, while building the individual and collaborative skills you need to thrive academically and professionally. The class will make visits to local archives and museums. Students will work individually on a semester-long project related to the topic of the course that will highlight the hidden histories of the Harlem Renaissance in Philadelphia. Assignments will be scaffolded in preparation for a final project and substantial class time will be devoted to working on projects and receiving feedback.

In this course, we will explore histories and theories of listening and the power of listening as a means to connect with other times and spaces. In a world replete with suffering, listening is an essential skill that can help us find solace and community together, connecting what is singular in us with what binds us to another. Mindful of the dissolution of communal bonds that have intensified in the face of recent pandemics and crises, both domestically and globally, the course will also engage matters of public trust and social cohesion. To lay the groundwork for a renewed sense of civic identity, we will partner with several initiatives and organizations at Penn and beyond that seek to transform our individual experiences into a collective power and demonstrate the vitality of listening to democratic life.

By engaging with a range of poems through brief response posts and close reading exercises, a creative adaptation, and a critical essay, you will develop your skills in formal and textual analysis and interpretation.

Others canceled their subscriptions to The Strand Magazine. Perhaps for the first time in history, fandom mobilized. And eventually, Conan Doyle brought Holmes back, writing 3 more collections of short stories and “The Hound of the Baskervilles.” In the interim, he permitted the actor William Gillette to revise the persona in a stage script, saying ""You may marry him, murder him, or do anything you like to him."" Since then, we have taken Conan Doyle at his word—revisiting and revising Sherlock in countless ways. This course will consider the phenomenon of Sherlock Holmes.

Why do many people enjoy the feeling of being scared? What narrative and cinematic techniques go into building suspense, turning your stomach, or making a ""jump scare"".

World Literature,ENGL 1179,Seminar,In Class,1,"How do we think 'the world' as such? Globalizing economic paradigms encourage one model that, while it connects distant regions with the ease of a finger-tap, also homogenizes the world, manufacturing patterns of sameness behind simulations of diversity. Our current world-political situation encourages another model, in which fundamental differences are held to warrant the consolidation of borders between Us and Them, ""our world"" and ""theirs."" This course begins with the proposal that there are other ways to encounter the world, that are politically compelling, ethically important, and personally enriching--and that the study of literature can help tease out these new paths. Through the idea of World Literature, this course introduces students to the appreciation and critical analysis of literary texts, with the aim of navigating calls for universality or particularity (and perhaps both) in fiction and film. ""World literature"" here refers not merely to the usual definition of ""books written in places other than the US and Europe, ""but any form of cultural production that explores and pushes at the limits of a particular world, that steps between and beyond worlds, or that heralds the coming of new worlds still within us, waiting to be born. And though, as we read and discuss our texts, we will glide about in space and time from the inner landscape of a private mind to the reaches of the farthest galaxies, knowledge of languages other than English will not be required, and neither will any prior familiary with the literary humanities. In the company of drunken kings, botanical witches, ambisexual alien lifeforms, and storytellers who've lost their voice, we will reflect on, and collectively navigate, our encounters with the faraway and the familiar--and thus train to think through the challenges of concepts such as translation, narrative, and ideology.

How have authors interpreted and responded to decolonisation, and relatedly, to emergent forms of neo-colonialism? How have these processes shaped contestations around issues of gender, race, class, caste and nation? This course will think through these concerns that continue to shape art, culture and society in the Global South today, long after the end of formal empire. We will analyze contemporary novels, short stories and essays addressing regions and contexts ranging from South Asia and West Africa to the Caribbean and post-war Britain. Texts will serve to introduce students to key authors and theoretical debates within the field of postcolonial literatures, and may include Chinua Achebe’s Thing Fall Apart, Arundhati Roy’s The God of Small Things and Frantz Fanon’s The Wretched of the Earth.

War and Representation,ENGL 1449,Seminar,In Class,1,"This class will explore complications of representing war in the 20th and 21st centuries. War poses problems of perception, knowledge, and language. The notional ""fog of war"" describes a disturbing discrepancy between agents and actions of war; the extreme nature of the violence of warfare tests the limits of cognition, emotion, and memory; war's traditional dependence on declaration is often warped by language games--""police action,"" ""military intervention,"" ""nation-building,"" or palpably unnamed and unacknowledged state violence. Faced with the radical uncertainty that forms of war bring, modern and contemporary authors have experimented in historically, geographically, experientially and artistically particular ways, forcing us to reconsider even seemingly basic definitions of what a war story can be. Where does a war narrative happen? On the battlefield, in the internment camp, in the suburbs, in the ocean, in the ruins of cities, in the bloodstream? Who narrates war? Soldiers, refugees, gossips, economists, witnesses, bureaucrats, survivors, children, journalists, descendants and inheritors of trauma, historians, those who were never there? How does literature respond to the rise of terrorist or ideology war, the philosophical and material consequences of biological and cyber wars, the role of the nuclear state? How does the problem of war and representation disturb the difference between fiction and non-fiction? How do utilitarian practices of representation--propaganda, nationalist messaging, memorialization, xenophobic depiction--affect the approaches we use to study art? Finally, is it possible to read a narrative barely touched or merely contextualized by war and attend to the question of war's shaping influence? The class will concentrate on literary objects--short stories, and graphic novels--as well as film and television. Students of every level and major are welcome in and encouraged to join this class, regardless of literary experience.",Not available,Enrollment in this course is restricted.

Modern and Contemporary U.S. Poetry,ENGL 1830,Lecture,In Class,1,"Some versions of this course survey American poetry from the colonial period to the present, while others begin with Whitman and Dickinson and move directly into the 20th century and beyond. Typically students read and discuss the poetry of Williams, Stein, Niedecker, H.D., Pound, Stevens, Fearing, Rakoksi, McKay, Cullen, Wilbur, Plath, Rich, Ginsberg, Kerouac, Waldman, Creeley, Ashberry, O'Hara, Corman, Bernstein, Howe, Perelman, Silliman, and Retallack.

Aside from providing a survey and chronology of 20th- and 21st-century poetry, this version of English 1830 will offer one -- we think, helpful -- way of understanding the transition from modernism to postmodernism. Thus some students may wish to enroll as much to gain an understanding of the modernism/postmodernism problem through a study of recent poetry as to gain access to the work of these many poets. Students do not need to have any prior knowledge of poetry or poetics. English 88 operates almost entirely as a discussion, the lecture having been replaced here by online materials, by audio and video files and other info and context delivered digitally. Students will join the ModPo course, an open global online community (typically of 70,000 people!), and will engage with members of that community in conversation about our poems, will participate in several live webcast sessions, and will join other events associated with ModPo. Requirements will include many one-page ""position"" papers, peer-reviewing, and a wildly comprehensive final examination. The course will be held in the Arts Cafe of the Kelly Writers House at 3805 Locust Walk. Every class session features 100% discussion.

Witchcraft and the Occult,ENGL 1860,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will introduce students to major dramatic works of the medieval and early modern periods, including plays written for the public stage, closet dramas, masques, mayoral pageants, and other kinds of performances. The course will also pay attention to the development of different dramatic genres during these periods, as well as the social and cultural contexts in which they were produced.

Far from just stage figures, however, witches and supernatural powers were believed to abound in the early modern world. Historical documents record actual cases of witchcraft and demonic possession, attesting to contemporary beliefs concerning harmful magic and revealing how anxieties associated with the occult resulted in accusations, legal proceedings, and executions. In this class, we will explore a variety of these source texts as we read English Renaissance plays which feature witches, demons, ghosts, and spirits. We will consider the difference between belief and superstition, the links between religion and politics, and the intersection between imagination and performance. We will also examine the legacy of these themes in our own popular culture, including on film. Texts will include Doctor Faustus, Daemonologie, Macbeth, The Witch of Edmonton, and more.

In this class, we will examine these issues in the past as well as the present by studying Othello from a variety of critical perspectives through close-analysis of the play-text and adaptations on film and stage, beginning with the play’s earliest performance. We will first devote several weeks to read slowly and closely the text of the play by paying attention to Shakespeare’s use of language, metaphor, genre, and dramatic form. Then we will investigate the complex meanings of race, religion, gender, social status and sexuality in premodern England through Othello as well as other medieval and early modern materials. Besides recent interpretative criticism and the performance history of the play, including the use of blackface on stage and in film, the course will also include global adaptations of the play in various forms from Verdi’s opera Otello to Bhardwaj’s film Omkara, Toni Morrison’s play Desdemona and Tayeb Salih’s novel Season of Migration to the North. Our goal throughout the course will be discussing the relevance of Othello to our understanding of race, religion, gender, sexuality, class, and immigration today. Using Othello and its afterlives as a case study, therefore, this class aims a deliberate exploration of not only “Literature before 1660,” but also its relevance in contemporary world.",Not available,"ENGL Difference and Diaspora (AEDD)

On the Stage and in the Streets: An Introduction to Performance Studies,ENGL 1890,Seminar,In Class,1,"What do Hamilton, RuPaul’s Drag Race, political protest, TikTok Ratatouille, and Queen Elizabeth’s funeral have in common? They all compose repertoires of performance. From artistic performances in theatres, galleries, and concert halls to an individual’s comportment in everyday life, to sporting events, celebrations, courtroom proceedings, performance studies explores what happens when embodied activities are repeatable and given to be seen. In this course we ask: what is performance? How do we describe, analyze, and interpret it? What do theatre and everyday life have in common? How does performance legitimize or challenge the exercise of power? How has social media shifted our understanding of the relationship of our daily lives to performance? How does culture shape what is considered to be performance and how it functions? What isn’t performance? Throughout the semester students will apply key readings in performance theory to case studies drawn from global repertoires of contemporary and historical performance. In addition to analyzing artistic performances, we will also consider sporting events, celebrations, political events, and the performance of everyday life. We will attend to the challenges provoked by performance’s embodied, ephemeral, affective, effective, relational, and contingent aspects.

Movie Musicals: From Oz to La La Land,ENGL 1892,Seminar,In Class,1,"The very first major sound film—The Jazz Singer, in 1927—featured not only speaking, but also singing. Audiences around the country hungrily consumed this new cinematic genre—one that was also strongly influenced by the stage musicals that were taking New York by storm. The synergy between Hollywood and Broadway was electric. Virtually every major composer and lyricist, including Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Rodgers and Hammerstein, worked both coasts. At the same time, the movies created new film celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Judy Garland, The Nicholas Brothers, and more. In the Depression 42nd Street, The Wizard of Oz, and Stormy Weather provided entertaining escapism—and sometimes a critical lens into reality. As time moved on movie musicals moved with them… and continue to do so. Jailhouse Rock, A Hard Day’s Night, Sparkle, The Who’s Tommy, Robert Altman’s Nashville, and Damien Chazelle’s La La Land are just a few of the films that reinvent and even subvert the genres, while showcasing stars from Elvis Presley to Tina Turner to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Movie Musicals will explore the development of this form and the artists who made it, including Busby Berkeley, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Bob Fosse, Baz Luhrmann… and of course, Walt Disney.

Epic Tradition: Dido through the Ages,ENGL 2000,Seminar,In Class,1,"This advanced seminar will examine the classical backgrounds of western medieval literature, in particular the reception of classical myth and epic in the literature of the Middle Ages. Different versions of the course will have different emphases on Greek or Latin backgrounds and on medieval literary genres. Major authors to be covered include Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and the Gawain-poet.","In his Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BCE), the Roman poet Virgil created the most enduring narrative of Dido, Queen of Carthage. Virgil invents the romance between Dido and the hero Aeneas, and has her kill herself when Aeneas leaves Carthage to carry out his imperial mission to Italy. But the figure of Dido quickly got away from Virgil’s conception to establish a literary and artistic life of its own, from Ovid’s treatment of Dido all the way to the twenty-first century. In this class we will trace the reception of Dido in poetry, philosophy, drama, art, opera, and dance through antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modernity. Dido is one of the most intriguing figures in literary history, on the one hand a feminist icon from the Middle Ages onward, and on the other hand a blank surface on which to test out different narratives of womanhood, gender roles, and political power. In this class we will study many cultural remakings of Dido, including: the poetry of Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and Christine de Pizan; the dramatic realization in Christopher Marlowe’s renaissance tragedy of Dido; Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas (1689) as well as other operas based on the Dido story; the regendering of Dido in Mark Morris’ dance adaptation (1989) of Purcell’s opera; and the Dido and Aeneas story in painting.",Not available,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

The Romantic Book,ENGL 2041,Seminar,In Class,1,This course explores an aspect of Romantic literature intensively. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.,"This course makes the book itself an object of interpretation and a means for understanding literature of the Romantic Period. Rather than surveying a few poems by many writers, we will read 10 writers in depth. Most important, we will read them in the exact, published forms in which they were read and reviewed by their peers. How did authors and publishers compile, organize, and market books to a reading public? How is it different reading a poem, essay, or short story in the context of a larger collection instead of on its own? To answer these questions, we will thoroughly acquaint ourselves with the careers of each writer we read, with how their books were produced and reviewed, and with the contexts into which each book ventured into the world. This course will be a true seminar, in which we come to a table to discuss common interests and, through our discussions, come to more informed opinions -- and further interests. For that reason, do tell me if you have particular authors and interests in the Romantic Period (roughly 1770-1848) you wish to pursue. I plan to choose our course texts from the books below, and invite interested students to tell me their reading preferences: Henry Mackenzie, The Man of Feeling (1771); Anna Letitia Barbauld, Poems (1773); Charlotte Smith, Elegiac Sonnets (1784); Helen Maria Williams Poems (1786); Robert Burns, Poems Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect (1786); Olaudah Equiano, The Interesting Narrative (1789); The British Album (1790); William Blake, Songs of Innocence and Experience (1789, 1794); an issue of The Anti-Jacobin, or Weekly Examiner (1797); Joanna Baillie, Plays on the Passions (1798); William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lyrical Ballads, with a few other Poems (1800); Mary Robinson, Lyrical Tales (1800); William Blake, Milton (1804); William Wordsworth, Poems, in Two Volumes (1807); Lord Byron, The Giaour (1813); Walter Scott, Waverley (1814); Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Christabel, Kubla Khan, and the Pains of Sleep (1816); Mary Shelley, Frankenstein (1818); Percy Bysshe Shelley, Prometheus Unbound and other Poems (1820); John Keats, Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and other Poems (1820); an issue of Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine; Percy Shelley, Posthumous Poems (1824); Felicia Hemans, Records of Woman (1828); The Keepsake (1829); an issue of The Lady's Magazine (1830).",Not available,"ENGL 19th Century Literature (AE19)

What is Realism?,ENGL 2050,Seminar,In Class,1,This course explores an aspect of 19th-century literature intensively. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.,"What does it mean to call art “realist”? How did this term, first used to describe a controversial movement in French painting, quickly become a keyword in literature and other media? In fiction, is realism a question of subject matter or of style and form? What modes of perception, ways of knowing, aesthetic values, or attitudes toward the world does realist representation entail? How does it relate to probability, empiricism, and historical time; to topics like money, marriage, and social norms; to ideas of ordinariness or “the everyday” as they shape character, setting, and plot; or to frameworks like the domestic sphere, the nation-state, empire, and the global market? What happens when we apply the concept of realism forward or backward in time, or when it moves across geographies and cultural contexts? In this seminar we can approach these and other questions partly by examining realist novels and other artworks, and partly by considering some categories and genres that realism seems to oppose (romance, the Gothic, idealism, sentimentalism, melodrama, sensationalism, utopia), as well as movements like naturalism and modernism that questioned realism’s claims to artistic truth. Readings may include Flaubert’s Madame Bovary, George Eliot’s Middlemarch, Machado de Assis’ Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas, George Gissing’s New Grub Street, and Tsitsi Dangarembga’s Nervous Conditions, along with selections of critical and theoretical writing on realism, past and present.",Not available,"ENGL 19th Century Literature (AE19)

August Wilson and Beyond,ENGL 2222,Seminar,In Class,1,"""The people need to know the story. See how they fit into it. See what part they play.” - August Wilson, King Hedley II If you want to get to know community members from West Philadelphia, collaborate deeply with classmates, gain deeper and more nuanced understandings of African American history and culture, engage in a wide range of learning methods, and explore some of the most treasured plays in the American theatre, then this is the course for you. No previous experience required, just curiosity and willingness to engage. In this intergenerational seminar, Penn students together with older community members read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traditions, traumas, and triumphs through the decades, nearly all told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. (Two of Wilson’s plays are receiving fresh attention with recent acclaimed film versions: Fences with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis; Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom with Davis and Chadwick Boseman.) Class participants develop relationships with one other while exploring the history and culture that shaped these powerful plays. As an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, the class plans and hosts events for a multigenerational, West Philadelphia-focused audience with community partners West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance / Paul Robeson House & Museum, and Theatre in the X. Class members come to a deeper understanding of Black life in Philadelphia through stories community members share in oral history interviews. These stories form the basis for an original performance the class creates, presented at an end-of-semester gathering. Wilson's plays provide the bridge between class members from various generations and backgrounds. The group embodies collaborative service through the art and connection-building conversations it offers to the community.","In this intergenerational seminar, Penn students together with community members of all ages read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traditions, traumas, and triumphs through the decades, nearly all told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. Two of Wilson’s plays are receiving fresh attention with recent acclaimed film versions: Fences with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis; Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom with Davis and Chadwick Boseman. All class participants get to know each other while exploring the history and culture that shaped these ten powerful plays. As an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, the class plans and hosts events with community partner the West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance / Paul Robeson House & Museum, and also collaborates with the artists of Theatre in the X. Participants come to understand Philadelphia’s rich history through stories community members share in oral history interviews. These stories form the basis for an original performance the class creates, presented at an end-of-semester gathering. Wilson's plays provide the bridge between the generations.

W.E.B. Du Bois,ENGL 2250,Seminar,In Class,1,This course explores an aspect of race and ethnicity intensively. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.,"W.E.B. Du Bois In Black Reconstruction in America, Du Bois writes: “What was slavery in the United States? Just what did it mean to the owner and the owned?” But these are trick questions in a work of history that dwells in the moment of slavery’s endtime to consider the failure of emancipation and reconstruction to materialize black freedom. The questions become, What was jubilee? Just what did it mean? Did slavery end? This course examines Du Bois’ six decade struggle to come to terms, in language, with the receding promise of emancipation (which he called the “negro apocalypse”). We trace the poetics of heartbreak in John Brown, The Souls of Black Folk, Black Reconstruction in America (selections), Dusk of Dawn, Dark Princess and other writings.

Knights kiss one another in vows of eternal love – and dress as courtly maidens. A religious ascetic adopts a eunuch disguise, then new pronouns and a new name. This course explores 'queers before queerness': the fascinating, fluctuating ways gender, sex, and sexuality were defined and experienced in the premodern literary tradition. We will examine the porous boundaries of gender and sexuality – and the ways those concepts express, uphold, and undermine normative ideas and anxieties about power, embodiment, immortal souls, and erotic desires – in medieval English literature, from epic poetry to Arthurian romance. We will engage with current gender and queer theory, learning to use these frameworks to read literature productively, and (most importantly) discover the ways in which medieval ideas about gender, sex, sexuality, and the self continue to inform contemporary discourse and shape modern culture.",Students with a semester level of Freshman may not enroll.,"ENGL Difference and Diaspora (AEDD)

Happily Ever After?,ENGL 2355,Seminar,In Class,1,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that there are no more famous opening words than “Once upon a time”. They are familiar to the point of ubiquity, beloved, demanded, simply accepted as a promise that something extraordinary is about to unfold. And, in fairy tales, something always does. In this course, we will focus not on that promise (after all, it’s an immutable truth), but on the less immutable “Happily ever after” that we expect to have follow. Because not every tale ends happily for anyone, let alone everyone. Just ask most fictional stepmothers. And even for the winner, the path is seldom smooth. We will examine fairy tales and folklore across continents and centuries, considering both form and function in how they stand as both rulebook and cautionary tale, specifically as they speak to gender. What determines success in these tales? Who deserves to win? The ambitious young man with few resources but plenty of ambition and cunning? The beautiful girl with few expectations but boundless patience? What, really, are the messages in these age-old tales? In their contemporary adaptations? When we sing along loudly with Queen Elsa of Disney’s Frozen, exhorting each other to “Let It Go”, what is it? Materials will include the traditional fantastical (Grimm’s tales, One Thousand and One Nights, Ghanaian folklore, The Odyssey, Pride and Prejudice), to the modern (Disney Disney Disney, Hayao Miyazaki, Angela Carter, Barbie) to the scholarly (Bettelheim, Lieberman, Kristeva, Warner).",Not available,Enrollment in this course is restricted.

We will examine sources now considered to be “literature” and those that tend to be more studied in “history,” and we won’t be particularly finicky about the differences. Our strategy is to introduce, each week, a range of topics and questions, including: * Colonization, missionization, and printing * Writing and revolution, printing and politics * Black and Indigenous print cultures * Gender, reading, and book history * Technology and change * Bookselling and marketing. The seminar will be held at the Kislak Center in Van Pelt Library and feature its rare book and manuscript collections. A number of seminar meetings will also be held at the Library Company of Philadelphia (1314 Locust Street), an extraordinary research library founded by Franklin in 1731.

But what about AI that that can earn a B+ on an MBA exam without studying, phones that unlock with facial recognition that doesn’t work smoothly on all skin colors, or autonomous weaponized drones that mistake civilians for targets? As algorithms play an increasing role in various aspects of modern society, addressing their ethical considerations becomes increasingly crucial to ensure their responsible and beneficial use. This course explores the ethical dimensions and implications inherent in algorithms and their associated technologies in a wide variety of contexts. Topics will range from the intricacies of privacy invasion and the mitigation of bias to the establishment of accountability in the use of algorithms in fields such as education, healthcare, finance, criminal justice, employment, environmental issues, urban planning, and weapons of war. We will critically analyze academic research, policy debates, and case studies to develop a nuanced understanding of the ethical considerations surrounding algorithms. Students will engage with cutting-edge scholarship and contribute to ongoing discussions on algorithmic ethics.

This course is suitable for beginners as well as more experienced writers with an interest in sports. To learn more about this course, visit the Creative Writing Program at https://creative.writing.upenn.edu.","Sports shape our lives as individuals, as families, and as communities. Whether a runner completing a marathon for charity, a high school hopeful’s quest for a scholarship, or a pro team clinching—or falling short of—a title, the highs and lows of an athletic journey, when combined with literary devices, insightful reflection, and occasionally just the right amount of indulgence, make for stories that teach and inspire. Even those of us who are true amateur athletes, exclusively spectators, or even sports skeptics can tap into the emotions that sports evoke. And as we have seen recently, as well as throughout history, sports provide a crucial platform for social, political, and cultural issues via circumstances both on and off the court, field, or track. A key question we’ll ask throughout the semester is: how can storytelling enable us to leave sports better than we found them?  Over the course of the semester, students in our workshop will compose a personal essay from the perspective of an athlete or fan, a reported piece on an athlete, team, or event, and a short story that centers around athletics. For their final project, students will complete a longer piece in one of these modes, along with a revision of an earlier draft. As students develop their own sports stories, we will be joined by in-class guests and we will read the work of impactful storytellers like Toni Cade Bambara, Roger Angell, John McPhee, Leslie Jamison, Hanif Abdurraqib, Mirin Fader, and Penn’s own Buzz Bissinger, Sam and Max Apple, and Dan McQuade.

To learn more about this course, visit the Creative Writing Program at https://creative.writing.upenn.edu.","This class will use two genres of nonrealist writing as an introduction to the core concepts of writing creative prose. We will read work in fantasy and magical realism across the traditions of surrealism, science fiction, slipstream, Afrofuturism, fairy tales, and speculative memoirs, and we will try our hand at creating our own original work in these forms. Core craft concepts—including characterization, point of view, imagery, embodiment, pacing, scene and structure—form the foundation of our study, essential for all prose writing and particularly works of invented worlds and altered realities. In addition, we will discuss concepts such as world-building, entertainment, escapism, wonder, cognitive estrangement, and the grotesque BOTH as vital forces that inform our relationship to the world, AND as tactics to be cultivated through practice. The literature of the imagination comprises a tradition older, more extensive and more varied than the literary realism that is the focus of so much creative writing study.

But experience can be an elusive thing to capture: a strange hybrid of the highly subjective and the more tangible zone of perceptible fact. How do we strike a balance in narrative nonfiction? For one, we employ the same devices that we already use to navigate our way through the world—that of our senses. The more vivid the details of sight, touch, smell, taste, and sound, the more immersed the reader will become in the author’s re-created world of words. But what of the more abstract, less concrete sixth sense of thought? After all, it is our mind that perceives and finds the subjective meaning in experience. In this narrative nonfiction writing workshop, we will look at craft, literary technique, the mechanics of building vivid and powerful scenes, discuss the role of story-logic, and the importance of hard fact-checking.

Students will write weekly, chronicling and analyzing the twists and turns of campaign rhetoric, campaign ads, and media coverage; presidential debates will be grist for much of our writing. To learn more about this course, visit the Creative Writing Program at https://creative.writing.upenn.edu.","Ben Bradlee, a legendary Washington Post editor, once said that political journalism is “the first rough draft of history,” an opportunity to report and write about the tumultuous civic life of this nation as it unfolds in real time. And it has rarely been as tumultuous as it is right now, with democracy itself on the ballot in the 2024 election. We live in an era when even the very definition of truth is widely under assault. And with the news cycle spinning faster than ever before, we will spend much of our time in this course time feeding off the news as it happens. National politics is a 24/7 staple on streaming sites, social media, and in the minds of tens of millions of Americans who struggle to make sense of the news overload. Political journalists have a great challenge: seemingly by the hour, they are tasked with making smart judgments, supporting their analyses with empirical reportage, and communicating those judgments in clear language. They must cut through the clutter and engage the reader—smartly and often entertainingly—in a climate where journalists are derided in some circles as “enemies of the people.” They must respond in real time to events, statements, and upheavals that could never have been anticipated. The students in this course will be tasked to do the same, writing pieces that will be workshopped in class. We will also get the opportunity to air broader issues: Is traditionally objective “both sides” journalism up to the task of watchdogging the newsmakers in an era when democracy itself is under serious threat? Is it feasible to provide “balanced” coverage of two parties when many members of one party, starting with its likely presidential nominee, have been openly working to undermine democracy? This course, tracking a fast-moving presidential campaign, could not be more timely. Only true “junkies” of national politics—those who follow the news closely, and those who aspire to write about it—are likely to love this course. At a time when Americans are more awash in political news than ever, the goal of this course is to help students master the craft of writing clear, responsible, incisive, substantive, and engaging political journalism—and backing it up with factual research/reporting. The hope is that students can live off the news and develop their “earned voice” via effective reporting, writing, and (most important of all) thinking.",Not available,"ENGL Creative Writing Workshop Course Minor (AECW)

In this class you will critically analyze and write responses to class readings; do writing exercises related to the work we read; and complete (and be workshopped on) a portfolio of creative writing (and art, if you choose) that bears witness to events that matter to you.

Discussions will address emergent research methods, advanced writing and critical thinking issues, and debates surrounding canonization. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of current offerings.","Charles Dickens wrote in the Preface to David Copperfield (1849-50) that he liked it “the best” of all his work, even going so far as to call himself a “fond parent” and the novel his “favourite child.” This famous coming-of-age tale is full of everything you’d expect from a Dickens novel: larger-than-life characters, dastardly villains, humor, romance, and tragedy set against the backdrop of industrial England. But the text also offers profound insights into the trauma and exploitation that children–especially orphans–encountered in Victorian England. In this course, we will interrogate literature’s relationship to social justice, using David Copperfield and the status of children as our primary case study. We will begin by reading the novel closely and thoughtfully. Along the way, we will familiarize ourselves with nineteenth-century “condition-of-England” novelists, essayists, and poets who argued that art had an important role to play in advancing social change. We will end the semester reading Barbara Kingsolver’s Pulitzer Prize-winning Demon Copperhead (2022), a distinctly American retelling of Dickens’s novel set in poverty-stricken Appalachia. What does Kingsolver’s adaptation suggest about David Copperfield’s continued relevance in our modern social context? All students will leave the course with a strong grasp of Victorian fiction and a greater awareness of the connection between art and politics.

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of current offerings.","Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson was an immense success since its first publication in the 19th century. It has been reissued hundreds of times, adapted time and time again to film and stage, and remained consistently in print since 1884. The novel’s influence has been so powerful, in fact, that historian Mike Davis described it as “a romance that generations of tourists and white Angelenos have confused with real history” as it “transformed selected elements of local history into romantic myth.” This One Series course takes up Ramona and its adaptations for film, stage, television, and radio to inquire into how adaptation transforms the myth over time. What are the sociopolitical stakes of film adaptations of Ramona in the first half of the 20th century, and how might these stakes transform by the early 2000s, when Ramona is adapted as a soap opera for television? Alongside Ramona, we will read plays, screen film and television adaptations, incorporate our own fiction writing, and engage with at least one guest speaker as we explore the enduring legacy of Ramona. For the final projects, students will have the choice of a critical essay or creative project.

The Quest for a Universal Language,ENGL 7177,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar is an exploration in European intellectual history. It traces the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language among humanity. The tantalizing question of the possibility of such a language has been a vital and thought-provoking inquiry throughout human history. If recovered or invented, such a language has the potential to explain the origins, physical reality, and meaning of human experience, fostering universal understanding and world peace. Greek philosophers grappled with the capacity of names to correctly denote things. In Judaic and Christian traditions, the notion that the language spoken by Adam and Eve perfectly expressed the nature of the physical and metaphysical world captivated the minds of intellectuals for nearly two millennia. In defiance of the biblical myth of the confusion of languages and peoples at the Tower of Babel, they persistently endeavored to overcome divine punishment and rediscover the path to harmonious life. In the 19th century, Indo-Europeanist philologists perceived an avenue to explore the early stages of human development by reconstructing a proto-language. In the 20th century, romantic idealists like the inventor of Esperanto, Ludwik Zamenhof, constructed languages to further understanding among estranged nations. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the concept of a universal and perfect language has served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Today, this idea reverberates in theories of universal and generative grammars, in the approach to English as a global language, and in various attempts to devise artificial languages, including those intended for cosmic communication. Each week, we examine a particular period and a set of theories to explore universal language projects. But above all, at the core of the course lies an examination of what language is and how it is used in human society.",Not available,Not available,Not available,W 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),Julia Verkholantsev,,,,,"COML 6177,REES 6177",,,[1.0]

"Considering Race, Class and Punishment in the American Prison System",ENGL 9017,Seminar,In Class,1,"This writing seminar will sharpen and expand our writing, while bringing to our hearts and minds a deeper understanding of the reality of imprisonment in the United States. This system never goes away. This year it is locking up more than 2,300,000 men, women and children—the highest per-capita rate of imprisonment in the world. Even when we know the statistics and watch shows about crime and jail on TV, what do we really know about life behind bars? For a year? Ten years? Life? As a young journalist, I saw how the criminal justice system was used to suppress Black leadership. I felt drawn to teach creative writing at Holmesburg Prison, to eventually investigate the state prison system, interview prisoners, make friendships, write a newspaper series, magazine articles, and my first book on the subject. For nearly five decades, I’ve observed the human cost of a prison system that connects and damages all of our lives and keeps people from poverty in place. In this course, we will seek insights in books and stories written from prisoners’ personal experiences. We’ll also read scholars—Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Angela Davis and others—who shed light on the historical repetitions and political exploitations. Guest speakers will include public defenders, parolees, former prisoners, and those fighting for prisoners’ rights and re-entry. Students will gain a more intimate understanding of how the legacies of slavery, racism, the prejudices of class, caste, and misogyny intersect and determine who goes to prison and who does not. Students will free-write for ten minutes a day, every day, and write personal reflections on readings, films, and guest speakers. Responses will lead to essays or stories that students write and present for class discussion. These key pieces may draw from observation, facts and imagination, and may traverse literary nonfiction, memoir, fiction, or poetry. We will present the best of your work in a reading at the end of the semester.","This writing seminar will sharpen and expand our writing, while bringing to our hearts and minds a deeper understanding of the reality of imprisonment in the United States.

Introduction to Energy Policy,ENMG 5020,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course provides an advanced introduction to the design and delivery of energy policy at various levels of government in the U.S. and beyond. Energy presents theoretical and practical challenges across many disciplines and professions, especially in the context of economic development and environmental sustainability at scales ranging from local to global. This course is intended to provide a broad overview of the institutions, legal frameworks, technologies, and markets involved in energy policy by exploring theories and case studies across these topics, with an emphasis on the energy transition necessitated by climate change. That said, a full introduction to energy policy requires multiple courses and Penn offers many salient ones across several schools including Law, Wharton, Weitzman, SAS, and SEAS. The primary goal of this course is to teach students how to think—rather than what to know—about energy policy. As such, this course provides both (a) a foundation for students who want to take additional courses on energy law, markets, technology, or policy and (b) a synthesis for students who have taken such courses and want to connect ideas and issues across disciplines and professions.

Energy Geopolitics and National Security,ENMG 5120,Seminar,In Class,1,"It's commonly accepted that national energy policies have direct impacts on regional security and global geopolitical dynamics. But what happens when energy itself becomes a national security issue? Contemporary headlines illustrate the risk of viewing energy policy strictly through an economic lens. Authoritarian states continue to weaponize energy resources against dependent global democracies, while democracies increasingly rely on high-profile energy sectoral sanctions and technology export controls as vital tools of economic statecraft. Both examples illustrate how actors can use energy strategically, in both offensive and defensive capacities. An understanding of these threats is essential to developing sound energy diplomacy strategies to ensure that the energy transition is realized in a way that supports regional stability, security, and human rights. This course will teach students how to develop multidisciplinary energy analysis, policy recommendations, and diplomatic strategies that can work to address these global energy security challenges. The course will assess as a case study the current European energy infrastructure landscape and ask students to propose infrastructure, regulatory, and physical/cyber security strategies from the perspective of a practitioner of energy diplomacy.

Clean Energy Technology Deployment to Achieve Net Zero,ENMG 5400,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course covers the levers within government (policy, regulatory agencies, legislation) and outside of government (communities, businesses, NGOs.) Any organization in pursuit of either a new energy technology or a decarbonizing one must understand and engage with these entities. To meet our net-zero goals in time, we must scale up deployment for deep decarbonization in parallel with the annual removal of gigatons of carbon dioxide from the accumulating pool in the atmosphere. There are, however, multiple barriers to deployment: high costs for first-of-a-kind technology demonstrations; lack of policy frameworks across the broad portfolio of approaches that enable nth-of-a-kind technologies to become universally affordable; and a lack of public acceptance of energy technologies in environmentally impacted communities. That said, by following the path from inception to application to deployment, we will unpack the multiple levers of governance required: the relationship between a vote, a bill, and, ultimately, a law. We’ll dig into the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, explore existing policy levers like 45Q (a tax credit and direct pay that can line up financing to capitalize 2nd- and 3rd-of-a-kind demonstrations). We’ll discuss the impact of non-governmental organizations, how think tanks can drive change, how communities can be engaged. Finally, we will examine the risks and benefits of technology demonstrations within communities: how regional resources, population density, availability of land and water impact the siting of projects; what legacy and future environmental justice impacts might result.",**Undergraduates interested in enrolling should submit a permission request.**,"Enrollment is limited to Graduate/Research, Law or Professional level students.",Not available,TR 12pm-1:29pm (8/27 to 12/9),Jennifer Wilcox,,,,,,,,[1.0]

Water Worlds: Cultural Responses to Sea Level Rise & Catastrophic Flooding,ENVS 1040,Seminar,In Class,1,"As a result of climate change, the world that will take shape in the course of this century will be decidedly more inundated with water than we're accustomed to. The polar ice caps are melting, glaciers are retreating, ocean levels are rising, polar bear habitat is disappearing, countries are jockeying for control over a new Arctic passage, while low-lying cities and small island nations are confronting the possibility of their own demise. Catastrophic flooding events are increasing in frequency, as are extreme droughts. Hurricane-related storm surges,tsunamis, and raging rivers have devastated regions on a local and global scale. In this seminar we will turn to the narratives and images that the human imagination has produced in response to the experience of overwhelming watery invasion, from Noah to New Orleans. Objects of analysis will include mythology, ancient and early modern diluvialism, literature, art, film, and commemorative practice. The basic question we'll be asking is: What can we learn from the humanities that will be helpful for confronting the problems and challenges caused by climate change and sea level rise?",Not available,Not available,"CMPL Globalization and Culture (ACLG)

Students will be expected to conduct field investigations, review scientific data and create indicator reports, working with stakeholders and presenting the results at an annual symposium. There is no metaphor like water itself to describe the cumulative effects of our practices, with every upstream action having an impact downstream. In our urban environment, too often we find degraded streams filled with trash, silt, weeds and dilapidated structures. The water may look clean, but is it? We blame others, but the condition of the creeks is directly related to how we manage our water resources and our land. In cities, these resources are often our homes, our streets and our communities. This course will define the current issues of the urban ecosystem and how we move toward managing this system in a sustainable manner. We will gain an understanding of the dynamic, reciprocal relationship between practices in an watershed and its waterfront.

Developing Environmental Policy,ENVS 5600,Seminar,In Class,1,"When we think of environmental policies in the USA, we may think of one or more laws geared to improve our nation's air, water, ecosystems, and biodiversity. However, environmental policies and policy-making comprise more than just specific laws and regulations. Making and implementing environmental policy is a process influenced by multiple political, cultural, and economic factors in addition to scientific factors, all of which impact the ability of policies to be effective, that is, to actually improve the environment. In this course, we develop a framework to analyze the effectiveness of the social actors, process and outcomes of environmental policy-making. We ask questions such as: How do policy makers define environmental problems and solutions? Who are the social actors involved in the process? How are policies created and negotiated? What underlying assumptions and realities about the roles of government and society shape policy instruments and design? Are science and risk accurate or distorted? How are social and environmental justice intertwined? To answer these complex questions, we contextualize and critically analyze policies to determine how both government and society impact on regulatory approaches. We study the institutions involved and examine social and ecological outcomes of environmental policies. We also discuss contemporary issues and policy situations that arise throughout the course of the semester, and comment on them in a class blog. Finally, students will select an environmental issue and formulate a policy proposal to recommend to decisionmakers.",Not available,Enrollment limited to students in a Master of Environmentl Studies degree.,MES Environmental Policy Elective (BMEP),R 5:15pm-8:14pm (8/27 to 12/9),Joseph Lisa,3.9,3.9,2.0,2.0,,,,[1.0]

Floodplain Management in a Changing Climate,ENVS 6611,Lecture,In Class,1,"According to a 2019 paper by Scott A. Kulp and Benjamin H. Strauss, published in Nature Communications, 230 million people worldwide occupy land that is less than 1 meter above current high tide. By 2100, land now home to 200 million people could sit permanently below the high tide line as a result of rising sea levels from heat-trapping pollution from human activities. Add to these coastal challenges the inherent flood risks in riverine and urban settings. How do we prepare and adapt? The class will explore the challenge of floodplain management in a changing climate through lectures, discussions, talks by guest experts, readings and multimedia. Our class will look at the United States National Flood Insurance Program, examine its goals, critique its 50-year plus history and debate reforms to the program at the same time the U.S. Congress is considering long overdo reauthorization of the program.

Mystics & Visionaries: Arts and Other Ways of Knowing,FNAR 3130,Seminar,In Class,1,"As a pioneer of abstraction in the early 1900's, Hilma Af Klint channeled a complex and highly original body of abstract symbolic work in secrecy. Using the upcoming Hilma Af Klint exhibition at the Guggenheim as a focus and departure point, this course will explore the ways in which artists have accessed alternative ways of seeing, knowing, and embodying non-visible realities as a source for their work. Accessing spiritual realms has been the subject of early European Modernisms investigations into Theosophy and Anthroposophy, as well as the primary intention of Tibetan Thangkas and Indian Tantra paintings. Postmodernism's crisis of belief and skepticism generated a cultural situation wherein the subject of spirituality was marginalized, ridiculed as anti- intellectual, and in disgrace. The Hilma Af Klint exhibition and surge of interest in her work signifies a new moment, where questions about consciousness and the nature of reality are being addressed with renewed vigor. How do we create space in a technology driven world for experiences that attempt to align the viewer/maker with the contemplative realm, heightened states of consciousness, or transcendence? We will examine a wide field of artists in an attempt to understand the possibilities of the ""spiritual"" in art and contemporary culture. This seminar will engage in readings, lectures, discussions, projects, and field trips. This course is appropriate for both grad and undergrad, art majors and non-majors alike.",Please email professor Jackie Tileston (tileston@design.upenn.edu) for approval to enroll should a seat become available.,"Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.

Is This Really Happening? Performance and Contemporary Political Horizons (SNF Paideia Course),FNAR 3161,Seminar,In Class,1,"This class addresses the meeting points inside of and between a range of resistant performance practices with a focus on artists using performance to address political and social encounters in the contemporary moment. Performance, a chaotic and unruly category that slides across music, dance, theater and visual art, has long been a container for resistant actions/activities that bring aesthetics and politics into dynamic dialogue. Embracing works, gestures, movements, sounds and embodiments that push against and beyond the conventions of a given genre, performance can't help but rub uncomfortably against the status quo. Scholars working across Performance Studies and Black Studies importantly expanded critical discourse around performance to address the entanglement of the medium with physical, psychic, spatial and temporal inhabitations of violence and power. Generating copious genealogies of embodied resistance, this scholarship instigates a complex, interdisciplinary and multidimensional perspective on intersections between art and life, performance and politics. The class hosts a series of public lectures, presentations and performances by visual artists, choreographers, theater artists, composers/musicians, performers, curators and activists engaged with the social and political moment. Presentations will be open to the public with students in the course developing in-depth research into the work of each visiting artist/performer/presenter to engage the larger context of each visitor's scholarship and/or practice through readings, discussion and in-class presentations.

Mystics & Visionaries: Arts and Other Ways of Knowing,FNAR 5061,Seminar,In Class,1,"As a pioneer of abstraction in the early 1900's, Hilma Af Klint channeled a complex and highly original body of abstract symbolic work in secrecy. Using the upcoming Hilma Af Klint exhibition at the Guggenheim as a focus and departure point, this course will explore the ways in which artists have accessed alternative ways of seeing, knowing, and embodying non-visible realities as a source for their work. Accessing spiritual realms has been the subject of early European Modernisms investigations into Theosophy and Anthroposophy, as well as the primary intention of Tibetan Thangkas and Indian Tantra paintings. Postmodernism's crisis of belief and skepticism generated a cultural situation wherein the subject of spirituality was marginalized, ridiculed as anti- intellectual, and in disgrace. The Hilma Af Klint exhibition and surge of interest in her work signifies a new moment, where questions about consciousness and the nature of reality are being addressed with renewed vigor. How do we create space in a technology driven world for experiences that attempt to align the viewer/maker with the contemplative realm, heightened states of consciousness, or transcendence? We will examine a wide field of artists in an attempt to understand the possibilities of the ""spiritual"" in art and contemporary culture. This seminar will engage in readings, lectures, discussions, projects, and field trips.

Consumer Financial Decision Making,FNCE 2020,Lecture,In Class,1,"Research shows that many individuals are profoundly underinformed about important financial facts and financial products, which frequently lead them to make mistakes and lose money. Moreover, consumer finance comprises an enormous sector of the economy, including products like credit cards, student loans, mortgages, retail banking, insurance, and a wide variety of retirement savings vehicles and investment alternatives. Additionally, recent breakthroughs in the FinTech arena are integrating innovative approaches to help consumers. Though virtually all people use these products, many find financial decisions to be confusing and complex, rendering them susceptible to fraud and deception. As a result, government regulation plays a major role in these markets. This course intended for Penn undergraduates considers economic models of household decisions and examines evidence on how consumers are managing (and mismanaging) their finances. Although academic research has historically placed more attention on corporate finance, household finance is receiving a brighter spotlight now-- partly due to its role in the recent financial crisis. Thus the course is geared toward those seeking to take charge of their own financial futures, anyone interested in policy debates over consumer financial decision making, and future FinTech entrepreneurs.",Note: Non-Wharton students use the waitlist form located on Finance Dept. website (https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/programs/undergraduate/) to request a seat in this course.

In terms of methodologies, we apply the non-arbitrage principle and the law of one price to dynamic models through three different approaches: the binomial tree model, the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model, and the simulation-based risk neutral pricing approach. The course covers a wide range of applications, including the use of derivatives in asset management, the valuation of corporate securities such as stocks and corporate bonds with embedded options, interest rate and credit derivatives, as well as crude oil derivatives.

It will explore how different buyers approach the process of finding, evaluating, and analyzing opportunities in the corporate-control market; how they structure deals and how deal structure affects both value creation and value division; how they add value after transaction completion; and how they realize their ultimate objectives (such as enhanced market position or a profitable exit). The course is divided into two broad modules. The first module covers mergers and acquisitions, and the second one studies buyouts by private equity partnerships.

Decolonizing French Food,FREN 0081,Seminar,In Class,1,"Wine and cheese, baguettes and croissants, multiple courses and fresh ingredients straight from the market—these are the internationally recognized hallmarks of French food. Yet, even as the practices surrounding the mythical French table have been deemed worthy of a place on UNESCO’s World Heritage List since 2010, culinary traditions in France remain persistently rooted in legacies of colonialism that are invisible to many. In order to “decolonize” French food, this seminar turns to art, literature, and film, as well as archival documents such as advertisements, maps, and cookbooks. In what ways do writers and filmmakers use food to interrogate the human, environmental, and cultural toll that French colonialism has taken on the world? How do their references to food demonstrate the complex cultural creations, exchanges, and asymmetries that have arisen from legacies of colonialism? We will interpret artworks, read literature (in English or in translation), and watch films (subtitled in English) that span the twentieth and twenty-first centuries by authors and directors from across the Francosphere—from Haiti, Guadeloupe, and Martinique in the Caribbean; to Mauritius in the Indian Ocean; from the Vietnamese diaspora in France, Canada, and the United States; to North, Central, and West Africa. Just as food can be examined from many angles, our discussions will focus on art, literature, and film, but also take into account perspectives from the fields of history, anthropology, and environmental studies. Moreover, we will employ the theoretical tools supplied by food studies, feminist and gender studies, critical race studies, and postcolonial studies.",Not available,Enrollment limited to students with the Penn Classification Freshman attribute.,"AFRC African Diaspora Studies (AAFD)

From the legacy of decolonization to the multicultural fervor of the 1998 Soccer World Cup, from the May 1968 civil protests to the Republican marches of 2015, we'll be delving into the major historical and cultural movements that have marked the contemporary period. How did France recover from German occupation and cope with further wars in its colonial territories? How did unprecedented rates of urbanization and immigration change the face of the country over the ensuing decades? Who have been the major players on the historical stage? And what are the political, cultural, and socioeconomic challenges facing France at the outset of the 21st century? These are some of the questions that will guide our investigation into the past 70 years of French history, a period as turbulent as it is rich in cultural production, and as complex as it is fascinating. Throughout the semester we will be especially attentive to images, in every sense of the word: the images of national identity that France projects to the world and to itself, but also pictorial representations of the country, its people and its territory.

Through our exploration of this broad sampling, we will learn how humorous and comedic works reflect their historical circumstances, and we will also arrive at a deeper theoretical understanding of different kinds of humor and comedy and how they function. In particular, we will try to answer the following questions: - Do humor and comedy inherently depend upon a sense of superiority? In other words, if we laugh, is it always at someone else’s expense? - Do comedy and humor simply reinforce established social hierarchies based on race, gender, and class, or can it provide a way to challenge them? - What makes French and Francophone humor culturally specific? For example, how is a French comedy different from an American one, and how can we trace the evolution of comedic tropes from the earliest known French comedic works to contemporary ones? - Why do scatology and body humor play such a prominent role in French comedic works? - What are some of the different modes of satire, and are they meant to change society or keep it static? - What can comedic works tell us about French republican universalism and its potential shortcomings?

Statistics for Public Policy,GAFL 6110,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course is GAFL 6110, the required course in statistical analysis for students in the Fels school. This is the required course in statistical analysis for public policy/public administration. Increasingly, this is a quantitative field. Even if you think you'll someday just be (say) a city manager, and not likely to use quantitative analysis yourself, you will likely find yourself working with quantitative data. For example, ""policy evaluation"" has become a buzzword in recent years in public management and examples involving Fels graduates-or their equivalents-abound. Did giving low-income children after-school tutoring improve their academic performance? Does expanding a free-lunch program reduce the number of student outbursts in classrooms? Did Philadelphia's ""big belly"" trash cans actually reduce the amount of litter on our streets? Answering any of these questions requires statistical analysis. This course aims to lay the groundwork for you to answer these (and many more!) questions. The point here is not to convince you to adopt a quantitative design for your own work, or that quantitative designs are the ""best"" designs for answering all questions. Rather, the goal is to give you a set of tools that will enable you to read, critique and eventually produce your own quantitative research.

The polar ice caps are melting, glaciers are retreating, ocean levels are rising, polar bear habitat is disappearing, countries are jockeying for control over a new Arctic passage, while low-lying cities and small island nations are confronting the possibility of their own demise. Catastrophic flooding events are increasing in frequency, as are extreme droughts. Hurricane-related storm surges,tsunamis, and raging rivers have devastated regions on a local and global scale. In this seminar we will turn to the narratives and images that the human imagination has produced in response to the experience of overwhelming watery invasion, from Noah to New Orleans. Objects of analysis will include mythology, ancient and early modern diluvialism, literature, art, film, and commemorative practice.

Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of antisemitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of a war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population, cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements, and waged a brutal war of extermination that aimed to racially reorder all of Europe. Thinking about Nazi racism and genocide, their origins and trajectories, in both its particular specifics and in a larger historical context is the main goal of this course.",Not available,Not available,"College-Sector - History & Tradition (AUHT)

"Introduction to Disability Studies: Form, Text, and Practices",GSWS 0500,Seminar,In Class,1,"This first year seminar fuses disability studies, queer theory, Black feminist theory, visuality studies, film theory, and disabled artistic practices. Centering the praxis of disability justice, this class asks students to think about practice and theory as an intertwined discipline. Students will study, write, and create works that looking towards models of production that center community based and interdependent relationality. Some areas that this course covers includes but is not limited to disability studies vs. crip theory, the history and legacy of AIDS epidemic, disability justice and mutual aid organizing, multi sensorial artistic practice, as well as tending to questions of labor, pain, excess, and debilitation. Disability studies has a long and complicated history of centering whiteness, domesticity, and the West in its models of rights-based advocacy. This class turns away from the white independent disabled superstar and towards the teachings of crip of color critique and disability justice to think beyond the terms and conditions that have been rectified as productive models in uplifting the “good disabled person.” We will use texts and teachings from Sins Invalid, Leah Lakshmi Piepzna Samarasinha, Octavia Butler, Audre Lorde, Park McArthur, Constantina Zavitsanos, Lochlann Jain, LaMarr Jurelle Bruce, Mel Chen, Kai Cheng Thom, and Sami Schalk to guide us in our efforts.

In this course we will examine how families are organized along the lines of gender, sexuality, social class, and race and how these affect family life. We will consider how family life is continually changing while at the same time traditional gender roles persist. For example, how ""greedy"" workplaces, which require long work hours, create work-family conflicts for mothers and fathers. We will also examine diverse family forms including single-parent families, blended families, families headed by same-gender parents, and families headed by gender non-conforming parents.

By focusing on figures writing from the margins, we will explore how radical approaches to narrative form and subject-matter invite us to think in new ways about desire and identity. We will read texts that blur the boundaries between fact and fiction, hybridizing the genres of poetry, drama, and autobiography to produce new forms of expression, such as the graphic novel, auto-fiction, and prose poetry. From Viriginia Woolf's gender-bending epic, Orlando, to Tony Kushner's Angels in America, this course traces how non-normative desire is produced and policed by social and literary contexts - and how those contexts can be re-imagined and transformed.",Not available,Not available,"College-Sector - Arts & Letters (AUAL)

Sociology of Gender,GSWS 1101,Lecture,In Class,1,"Gender is an organizing principle of society, shaping social structures, cultural understandings, processes of interaction, and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives, from their intimate relationships to their participation in work, family, government, and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system. Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior, power, and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender, in contrast, emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained, with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations. We will also seek to understand how social change happens and how gender inequality might be reduced.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC Minor African American (AAFN)

How do they express their thoughts and feelings to one another? In this course, we will explore some means Japanese culture has found to grapple with these events and sensations. We will also see how these culturally sanctioned frameworks have shaped the ways Japanese view love and loss. Our materials will sample the literary tradition of Japan from earliest times to the early modern and even modern periods. Close readings of a diverse group of texts, including poetry, narrative, theater, and the related arts of calligraphy, painting, and music will structure our inquiry.

Introduction to Queer Art,GSWS 1800,Lecture,In Class,1,"It's no exaggeration to note that queers have long been at the forefront of innovation in the arts, and that the arts, generally, have been a comfortable home for queers, even at moments when society at large was distinctly hostile. In fact the concepts of modern art and homosexuality that we use today are twins, for they were both founded in the third quarter of the 19th century and grew up together. Introduction to Queer Art thus begins with the coining of the word ""homosexual"" in 1869, and surveys how a range of mediums including painting, sculpture, poetry, music, and film shifted in response to new definitions of sexuality. Along the way, we will work towards answering two related questions: 1) Why were queer creators largely responsible for the introduction of modernity in the arts, and 2) why do we find so often that queer social and political dissent found form in, and as, aesthetic dissent as well? In creating new forms for art that often seem far removed from any traditional definition of sexuality, including non-objective and abstract art, queer artists pushed the boundaries of normativity, leading to new ways of seeing, hearing, feeling and thinking that often dared to encode queer meanings as part of their formal innovation. We will look into the politics of queer art, and how and why in the US, even amidst often dangerous homophobia, it was queer artists who represented America to itself. Thus, we will cover such key cultural figures such as Walt Whitman, Gertrude Stein, Georgia O'Keeffe, Frank O'Hara, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol, and Agnes Martin. Throughout, new methods informed by queer, gender, and critical race theory will be utilized.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cultural Diversity in US (AUCD)

In this class, we will examine these issues in the past as well as the present by studying Othello from a variety of critical perspectives through close-analysis of the play-text and adaptations on film and stage, beginning with the play’s earliest performance. We will first devote several weeks to read slowly and closely the text of the play by paying attention to Shakespeare’s use of language, metaphor, genre, and dramatic form. Then we will investigate the complex meanings of race, religion, gender, social status and sexuality in premodern England through Othello as well as other medieval and early modern materials. Besides recent interpretative criticism and the performance history of the play, including the use of blackface on stage and in film, the course will also include global adaptations of the play in various forms from Verdi’s opera Otello to Bhardwaj’s film Omkara, Toni Morrison’s play Desdemona and Tayeb Salih’s novel Season of Migration to the North. Our goal throughout the course will be discussing the relevance of Othello to our understanding of race, religion, gender, sexuality, class, and immigration today.

Epic Tradition: Dido through the Ages,GSWS 2000,Seminar,In Class,1,"This advanced seminar will examine the classical backgrounds of western medieval literature, in particular the reception of classical myth and epic in the literature of the Middle Ages. Different versions of the course will have different emphases on Greek or Latin backgrounds and on medieval literary genres. Major authors to be covered include Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and the Gawain-poet.","In his Aeneid (written between 29 and 19 BCE), the Roman poet Virgil created the most enduring narrative of Dido, Queen of Carthage. Virgil invents the romance between Dido and the hero Aeneas, and has her kill herself when Aeneas leaves Carthage to carry out his imperial mission to Italy. But the figure of Dido quickly got away from Virgil’s conception to establish a literary and artistic life of its own, from Ovid’s treatment of Dido all the way to the twenty-first century. In this class we will trace the reception of Dido in poetry, philosophy, drama, art, opera, and dance through antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and modernity. Dido is one of the most intriguing figures in literary history, on the one hand a feminist icon from the Middle Ages onward, and on the other hand a blank surface on which to test out different narratives of womanhood, gender roles, and political power. In this class we will study many cultural remakings of Dido, including: the poetry of Virgil, Ovid, Chaucer, and Christine de Pizan; the dramatic realization in Christopher Marlowe’s renaissance tragedy of Dido; Purcell’s opera Dido and Aeneas (1689) as well as other operas based on the Dido story; the regendering of Dido in Mark Morris’ dance adaptation (1989) of Purcell’s opera; and the Dido and Aeneas story in painting",Not available,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

Happily Ever After?,GSWS 2455,Seminar,In Class,1,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that there are no more famous opening words than “Once upon a time”. They are familiar to the point of ubiquity, beloved, demanded, simply accepted as a promise that something extraordinary is about to unfold. And, in fairy tales, something always does. In this course, we will focus not on that promise (after all, it’s an immutable truth), but on the less immutable “Happily ever after” that we expect to have follow. Because not every tale ends happily for anyone, let alone everyone. Just ask most fictional stepmothers. And even for the winner, the path is seldom smooth. We will examine fairy tales and folklore across continents and centuries, considering both form and function in how they stand as both rulebook and cautionary tale, specifically as they speak to gender. What determines success in these tales? Who deserves to win? The ambitious young man with few resources but plenty of ambition and cunning? The beautiful girl with few expectations but boundless patience? What, really, are the messages in these age-old tales? In their contemporary adaptations?

Sex Wars,GSWS 2650,Seminar,In Class,1,"In this course, we explore several “sides” of the conflict that raged between U.S. feminists four decades ago, as well as their entanglements with other political trajectories in the context of capitalist development. The aim is to shed light on contemporary discourses on sexual representation and sexual conduct as commonly framed under controversial rubrics such as “OnlyFans,” film ratings, “no kink at Pride,” sexting, “revenge porn,” sex-trafficking, and more. Rejecting or at least complicating the “pro-sex vs. anti-porn” definition of feminist history’s belligerent parties, students are invited to consider lesbian-socialist, working-class butch/femme, black feminist, youth-liberationist, sex-radical, and transfeminist permutations of the politics of “pleasure and danger,” going back significantly before the infamous flashpoint that was the 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality. Typically, “Barnard 1982” is lamented as a traumatizing event with a regrettable legacy. Yet is there something to be said in favor of the laying-bare of feminist enmities, indeed, enemy feminisms? Were there positive consequences? Further questions we might confront together on this course include the following: What is violent pornography? How (if at all) should it be produced, regulated, distributed, discussed, and consumed? What is violence against women, representationally? Why is it so prevalent in our culture and how might we change this? Whom do antiprostitution laws keep safe? What furthers the conditions of possibility for black feminist porn to flourish? Readings will include texts from Catharine MacKinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Susan Stryker, Gail Dines, Carol Leigh, Carole Vance, Lisa Duggan, Joan Nestle, Gayle Rubin, Jennifer Nash, Amber Hollibaugh, Ellen Willis, and Audre Lorde.",Not available,Not available,"GSWS Feminist Studies (AGWF)

Folklore and Sexuality,GSWS 2700,Lecture,In Class,1,"Sexuality is usually thought of as being biological or social, divided into categories of natural and unnatural. Often misssed are its creative and communicative aspects. Examining the constructed social elements of sexuality requires attention be paid to folklore in groups, between individuals and on the larger platform of popular technological media. The most interesting locations for exploration are those places where borderlands or margins, occur between genders, orientations and other cultural categories.

Sex with Shakespeare,GSWS 2860,Seminar,In Class,1,This course explores an aspect of drama before 1660 intensively. See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.,"This seminar will explore the history of sexuality in the West with Shakespeare from a historical and transnational perspective. In thinking sex, sexuality, and sexual acts with Shakespeare and his contemporaries to trace constitutive interlinks between literature, history, and socio-cultural dynamics, weekly discussions will focus on such topics as male homosexuality, lesbianism, sodomy, erotic friendship, crossdressing, transgender, sexualization of the other, prostitution, masochism, fetish, bestiality, and consent. Such discussion will be guided by various contextual foci from the early modern period: revival of classical tropes, translations, global encounters, discoveries and colonial expansions, material history, religious conversions, cartographic knowledge, emergent nationalism, race, and empire. As investigating continuities, ruptures, and crossings between discourses and practices in the past and the present, the seminar will also cover major critical debates in the field of early modern sexuality studies, and the current state of (and future directions in) the history of sexuality studies, queer theory, and trans studies. A premium will be placed on regular attendance and active participation. Assignments will include presentations, weekly responses, and a final research paper.",Students with a semester level of Freshman may not enroll.,"ENGL Drama (AEDR)

Sex in the Museum,GSWS 2872,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course maps the often fraught intercourse between the history of sexuality and the history of museums, exhibitions, and curation. Bodies have long been the mainstay of art, but the attribution of sex to those bodies is a highly variable social phenomenon that tells us as much about the culture in question as it does about ourselves. Sex is thus in the eye of the beholder, defined by cultural, religious, scientific, and political norms, themselves often defined in and through a politics of visibility and exhibition. Beginning in the ancient world and moving into the present, this course studies the sexual politics of display, inherent but little studied, in the history of art history. From Renaissance battles over fig leaves to Enlightenment Europe’s titillation at what they saw as the unbridled eroticism of the ancient world to the culture wars of today, sex has long been a hidden motor of shifts in the art world. Whether coming to understand the so-called “Free Body Culture” of turn of the 20th century Europe with its very public nudity, to the explosion in nude performance in the 1960s to the culture wars of the 1980s in the USA over an art that addressed queerness, AIDS, and their intersection, we’ll see how often exhibitions have served as proxy for other social and political issues. In this course we’ll also come to understand the distinction between the nude, a category in art, and the naked, a category that was often said to corrupt art. Reading the latest work in queer, feminist and anti-racist scholarship, we will see how easily bodies on display can turn into sex, and conversely, slip as easily back from sex into bodies again.",Not available,Not available,"ARTH Elective Major/Minor (AHAE)

Writing and Witnessing,GSWS 3501,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course will explore one of the fundamental questions we face as humans: how do we bear witness to ourselves and to the world? How do we live and write with a sense of response-ability to one another? How does our writing grapple with traumatic histories that continue to shape our world and who we are in it? The very word “witnessing” contains a conundrum within it: it means both to give testimony, such as in a court of law, and to bear witness to something beyond understanding. In this class, we will explore both senses of the term “witness” as we study work by writers such as Harriet Jacobs, Paul Celan, M. NourbeSe Philip, Bhanu Kapil, Layli Long Soldier, Claudia Rankine, Juliana Spahr, and others that wrestles with how to be a witness to oneself and others during a time of ongoing war, colonialism, racism, climate change, and other disasters. Students are welcome in this class no matter what stage you are at with writing, and whether you write poetry or prose or plays or make other kinds of art. Regardless of your experience, in this class you’ll be considered an “author,” which in its definition also means a “witness.” We will examine and question what authorship can do in the world, and we will analyze and explore the fine lines among being a witness, a bystander, a participant, a spectator, and an ally. In this class you will critically analyze and write responses to class readings; you’ll do writing exercises related to the work we read; and you’ll complete (and be workshopped on) a portfolio of creative writing (and/or art) that bears witness to events that matter to you.","This course will explore one of the fundamental questions we face as humans: how do we bear witness to ourselves and to the world?

We will survey histories of the moving image, film, and video art through the themes of remembrance, promise, death, and the sacred in order to ask questions of unrealized potentials, futurity, memory, and non-linear expressions. We will ask how artists have put pressure on straight concepts of time, pastness, and legacy. Our focus will be on how the medium of film and video can offer queer strategies and methods for intervening on dominant ideas of remembrance, while articulating our visions as critics, artists, and writers. This course is a seminar and production course for students who want to engage in research and experimental approaches to synthesis, with projects that could range from visual essays, films, lectures, poetry, and more.

Is it a hyper-masculine nation of samurai and economic warriors? Is it true that Japanese wives control the household? Is it true that Japanese men suffer from over-dependence on their mothers? What do young Japanese women and young men worry about? What does the government think about the future of Japanese women and men? Assuming that expressions of gender and sexuality are deeply influenced by cultural and social factors, and that they also show profound differences regionally and historically, this course examines a variety of texts--historical, biographical, autobiographical, fictional, non-fictional, visual, cinematic, analytical, theoretical--in order to better understand the complexity of any attempts to answer the above questions.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Black Political Thought: Difference And Community,GSWS 6550,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course is designed to familiarize graduate students with some of the key texts and debates in Africana Studies concerning the relationship between racial slavery, modernity and politics. Beginning with the Haitian Revolution, much of black political thought (thinking and doing politics) has advocated group solidarity and cohesion in the face of often overwhelming conditions of servitude, enslavement and coercion within the political economy of slavery and the moral economy of white supremacy. Ideas and practices of freedom however, articulated by political actors and intellectuals alike, have been as varied as the routes to freedom itself. Thus, ideas and practices of liberty, citizenship and political community within many African and Afro-descendant communities have revealed multiple, often competing forms of political imagination. The multiple and varied forms of political imagination, represented in the writings of thinkers like Eric Williams, Richard Wright, Carole Boyce Davies and others, complicates any understanding of black political thought as having a single origin, genealogy or objective. Students will engage these and other authors in an effort to track black political thought's consonance and dissonance with Western feminisms, Marxism, nationalism and related phenomena and ideologies of the 20th and now 21st century.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

"Considering Race, Class and Punishment in the American Prison System",GSWS 9017,Seminar,In Class,1,"This writing seminar will sharpen and expand our writing, while bringing to our hearts and minds a deeper understanding of the reality of imprisonment in the United States. This system never goes away. This year it is locking up more than 2,300,000 men, women and children—the highest per-capita rate of imprisonment in the world. Even when we know the statistics and watch shows about crime and jail on TV, what do we really know about life behind bars? For a year? Ten years? Life? As a young journalist, I saw how the criminal justice system was used to suppress Black leadership. I felt drawn to teach creative writing at Holmesburg Prison, to eventually investigate the state prison system, interview prisoners, make friendships, write a newspaper series, magazine articles, and my first book on the subject. For nearly five decades, I’ve observed the human cost of a prison system that connects and damages all of our lives and keeps people from poverty in place. In this course, we will seek insights in books and stories written from prisoners’ personal experiences. We’ll also read scholars—Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Angela Davis and others—who shed light on the historical repetitions and political exploitations. Guest speakers will include public defenders, parolees, former prisoners, and those fighting for prisoners’ rights and re-entry. Students will gain a more intimate understanding of how the legacies of slavery, racism, the prejudices of class, caste, and misogyny intersect and determine who goes to prison and who does not. Students will free-write for ten minutes a day, every day, and write personal reflections on readings, films, and guest speakers. Responses will lead to essays or stories that students write and present for class discussion. These key pieces may draw from observation, facts and imagination, and may traverse literary nonfiction, memoir, fiction, or poetry.

Funding Biotech,HCMG 8770,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"The biotechnology (biotech) industry is one of the most capital-intensive segments of the health care industry. The actual cost to bring a drug from the research labs to patients is estimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, and yet only 10% of all drugs that enter human testing are ever approved, often failing due poor safety or lackluster efficacy. Therefore, when you factor in the cost of these drug failures, the cost to get a drug approved can reach into the billions. And that’s not even considering the cost to market the drug once approved. Despite these inherent risks and high costs of drug development and marketing, there were $500 billion of equity capital invested annually into biotech companies over the past 10 years signaling a robust market where returns are disproportionate to risk. This course will explore funding these risky biotech ventures from two perspectives: the biotech CEO (primary focus of the course) and the biotech investor (secondary focus of the course). Students will learn about the various ways biotech companies are capitalized (e.g., equity, convertible/structured debt, licensing partnerships, clinical trial financing, royalty monetization, etc.) and the tradeoffs a biotech CEO considers when deciding which options to pursue at various stages of the company’s evolution. We will also explore first-hand how the biotech investor thinks about the firm’s capital structure when deciding to make an equity investment as well as understand the quantitative (e.g., market & competitive assessments, total financing needs of the firm, NPV) and qualitative (e.g., physician’s proclivity to prescribe, strength of management, etc.) diligence the biotech investor performs prior to making an investment. For the final project, students will analyze the capital requirements for a biotech company make recommendations based on the financing options available to the firm. Through readings, lectures, case studies, guest speakers, and a final project, students will learn concepts and analytical frameworks and acquire the tools and skills necessary to make important financing decisions as a biotech CEO.","Completion of FNCE 6110, Corporate Finance, is highly recommended by instructor.

Well-known figures like Henry Clay and Daniel Webster rose to power upon the back of their spoken words, and captivated national audiences with their literary utterances and rhetorical flourishes.

In this class— a seminar offered in collaboration with Penn's Communication Within the Curriculum program— students will accomplish two goals: first, learn about the political history of the nineteenth-century United States through studying the speeches of the century’s speech-makers; and, second, learn about the art of public-speaking through analyzing the methods and rhetorical tools employed by these historical figures.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in American History (AHCA)

During this period of Renaissance, Reformation, and Enlightenment, early modern Europe experienced a series of crises in authority that ushered in the modern world. The course will explore how new discoveries (both geographical and intellectual) challenged existing worldviews; movements of religious reform challenged the authority of the Church and the unity of Europe; and new political doctrines, accompanied by a series of striking rebellions, challenged the foundations of traditional rule. Our aim will be to excavate the changing social, political, intellectual, and cultural experiences of men and women during this time of renaissance, reformation, enlightenment, and revolution. We will follow the encounter between Europeans and the peoples of the Americas, Africa, and Asia, as well as the “discovery” of new ways to read old books, the “discovery” of new technologies in communications and combat, and the “discovery” of new sciences, arts, and philosophies as they impacted the way Europeans related to the wider world and their place within it.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

"Warriors, Concubines & Converts: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East & Europe",HIST 0310,Lecture,In Class,1,"For almost six hundred years, the Ottomans ruled most of the Balkans and the Middle East. From their bases in Anatolia, Ottoman armies advanced into the Balkans, Syria, Egypt, and Iraq, constantly challenging the borders of neighboring European and Islamicate empires. By the end of the seventeenth century, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Cairo, Baghdad, Sarajevo, Budapest, and nearly Vienna came under Ottoman rule. As the empire expanded into Europe and the Middle East, the balance of imperial power shifted from warriors to converts, concubines, and intellectuals. This course examines the expansion of the Ottoman sultanate from a local principality into a sprawling empire with a sophisticated bureaucracy; it also investigates the social, cultural, and intellectual developments that accompanied the long arc of the empire's rise and fall. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and discuss major currents of change in the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East. The student will have a better understanding of the roles of power, ideology, diplomacy, and gender in the construction of empire and a refined appreciation for diverse techniques of historical analysis.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

History of Modern China,HIST 0550,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"From an empire to a republic, from communism to socialist-style capitalism, few countries have ever witnessed so much change in a hundred year period as China during the twentieth century. How are we to make sense out of this seeming chaos? This course will offer an overview of the upheavals that China has experienced from the late Qing to the Post-Mao era, interspersed with personal perspectives revealed in primary source readings such as memoirs, novels, and oral accounts. We will start with an analysis of the painful transition from the last empire, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), to a modern nation state, followed by exploration of a century-long tale of incessant reform and revolution. The survey will focus on three main themes: 1) the repositioning of China in the new East Asian and world orders; 2) the emergence of a modern Chinese state and nationalistic identity shaped and reshaped by a series of cultural crises; and finally, 3) the development and transformation of Chinese modernity. Major historical developments include: the Opium War and drug trade in the age of imperialism, reform and revolution, the Nationalist regime, Mao's China, the Cultural Revolution, and the ongoing efforts of post-Mao China to move beyond Communism. We will conclude with a critical review of the concept of ""Greater China"" that takes into account Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the Chinese diaspora in order to attain a more comprehensive understanding of modern China, however defined, at the end of the last century.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

A few Greek myths at bedtime when we are kids, maybe a Greek tragedy like Sophokles' Oidipous when we are at school: these are often the only contact we have with the world of the ancient Mediterranean. The story of the Greeks, however, deserves a wider audience, because so much of what we esteem in our own culture derives from them: democracy, epic poetry, lyric poetry, tragedy, history writing, philosophy, aesthetic taste, all of these and many other features of cultural life enter the West from Greece. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi had inscribed over the temple, ""Know Thyself."" For us, that also means knowing the Greeks. We will cover the period from the Late Bronze Age, c. 1500 BC, down to the time of Alexander the Great, concentrating on the two hundred year interval from 600-400 BC.",Not available,Graduate/Research level students may not enroll.,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

"Portraits of Old Rus: Myth, Icon, Chronicle",HIST 0724,Seminar,In Class,1,"Three modern-day nation-states – Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus – share and dispute the cultural heritage of Old Rus, and their political relationships revolve around interpretations of the past. Has the medieval Rus state been established by the Vikings or by the local Slavs? Is early Rus a mother state of Russia or of Ukraine, and, therefore, should it be spelled ‘Kyivan Rus,’ or ‘Kievan Rus’ in English? Has the culture of Russian political despotism been inherited from the Mongols, or is it an autochthonous ideology? The constructed past has a continuing importance in modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and it is keenly referenced, often manipulatively, in contemporary social and political discourse. For example, President Putin invaded Ukraine under a pretense that its territory has “always” been an integral part of Russia and its history. The course covers eight centuries of cultural, political, and social history of the lands that are now within the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, from early historical records through the 18th century, a period that laid the foundation for the Russian Empire and the formation of modern nations. Students gain knowledge about formative events and prominent figures, as well as social and cultural developments during this period. The course takes multidisciplinary approach by combining the study of textual sources, objects of art and architecture, music, ritual, and film in their social and historical contexts. Students learn to analyze and interpret primary sources (historical documents and literary texts), identify their intellectual issues, and understand the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which these sources emerged. While working with these primary sources students learn to pose questions about their value and reliability as historical evidence. By exposing students to the critical examination of “the uses of the past,” the course aims to teach them to appreciate the authoritative nature of historical interpretation and its practical application in contemporary social and political rhetoric. The study of pre-modern cultural and political history through the prism of nationalism theories explains many aspects of modern Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian societies, as well as political aspirations of their leaders. At the end of the course, students should develop understanding of the continuity and change in the history of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, their belief systems, and nationalistic ideologies, and will be able to speak and write about these issues with competence and confidence.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Introduction to the Ancient Middle East,HIST 0730,Lecture,In Class,1,"The great pyramids and mysterious mummies of Egypt, the fabled Tower of Babel, and the laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi are some of the things that might come to mind when you think of the ancient Middle East. Yet these are only a very few of the many fascinating -- and at time perplexing -- aspects of the civilizations that flourished there c. 3300-300 BCE. This is where writing first developed, where people thought that the gods wrote down what would happen in the future on the lungs and livers of sacrificed sheep, and where people knew how to determine the length of hypotenuse a thousand years before the Greek Pythagoras was born. During this course, we will learn more about these other matters and discover their place in the cultures and civilizations of that area. This is an interdisciplinary survey of the history, society and culture of the ancient Middle East, in particular Egypt and Mesopotamia, utilizing extensive readings from ancient texts in translation (including the Epic of Gilgamesh, ""one of the great masterpieces of world literature""), but also making use of archaeological and art historical materials. The goal of the course is to gain an appreciation of the various societies of the time, to understand some of their great achievements, to become acquainted with some of the fascinating individuals of the time (such as Hatshepsut, ""the women pharaoh,"" and Akhenaten, ""the heretic king""), and to appreciate the rich heritage that they have left us.",Not available,Not available,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

Perspectives on Urban Poverty,HIST 0812,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to 20th century urban poverty, and 20th century urban poverty knowledge. In addition to providing an historical overview of American poverty, the course is primarily concerned with the ways in which historical, cultural, political, racial, social, spatial/geographical, and economic forces have either shaped or been left out of contemporary debates on urban poverty. Of great importance, the course will evaluate competing analytic trends in the social sciences and their respective implications in terms of the question of what can be known about urban poverty in the contexts of social policy and practice, academic research, and the broader social imaginary. We will critically analyze a wide body of literature that theorizes and explains urban poverty. Course readings span the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, urban studies, history, and social welfare. Primacy will be granted to critical analysis and deconstruction of course texts, particularly with regard to the ways in which poverty knowledge creates, sustains, and constricts meaningful channels of action in urban poverty policy and practice interventions.",Not available,Not available,"CRIM SocioPolitical (ACRS)

We will concern ourselves both with change over time in the construction and application of the law, and the persistence of the desire to control and sublimate enslaved people. Our work will include engagement with secondary sources as well as immersion in the actual legal documents. Students will spend some time working with Mississippi murder cases from the 19th century. They will decipher and transcribe handwritten trial transcripts, and will historicize and analyze the cases with attention to procedural due process as well as what the testimony can tell us about the social history of the counties in which the murders occurred.

History of American Law to 1877,HIST 1119,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course is designed to explore major themes and events in early American legal history. Because of the richness of the subject matter and the wealth of sources available, we will be selective in our focus. The course will emphasize several core areas of legal development that run throughout colonial and early national history: 1) the state: including topics such as war and other military or police action, insurrection, revolution, regulation, courts, economic policy, and public health; 2) labor: including race and racially-based slavery, varied forms of servitude and labor coercion, household labor, industrialization, unionization, and market development; 3) property: including property in persons, land, and business, and the role of lawyers in promoting the creation of wealth; 4) private spaces: including family, individual rights, sexuality, gender, and private relations of authority; 5) constitutionalism: various methods of setting norms (rules, principles, values) that create, structure, and define the limits of government power and authority in colonial/imperial, state, and national contexts; 6) democracy and belonging: including questions of citizenship, voting rights, and participation in public life. By placing primary sources within historical context, the course will expose students to the ways that legal change has affected the course of American history and contemporary life. The course will be conducted primarily in lecture format, but I invite student questions and participation. In the end, the central aim of this course is to acquaint students with a keen sense of the ways that law has operated to liberate, constrain, and organize Americans. Ideally, students will come away with sharper critical thinking and reading skills, as well. *This course is a core requirement for the Legal Studies and History Minor (LSHS).*",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

From social movements to hippies, the Sixties are often portrayed as a decade of unfettered idealism, chaos, and revolution. The Sixties were indeed a dramatic era of conflict and change, but the experiences of Americans who lived during the Sixties were also remarkably diverse and complex in ways that transcend stereotypes of the decade. More than merely a series of conflicts between activists and racists or hawks and doves, the Sixties represented a turning point in American life. The society that emerged in the wake of this profound decade was completely different than anything that had ever existed before. Through a variety of themes—especially gender, race, foreign policy, and consumer culture—this class will move beyond generic Sixties narratives to offer a multi-faceted examination of American life during the Sixties and explore how the decade has shaped the contemporary United States.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cultural Diversity in US (AUCD)

In one respect, the twentieth century was a strange time to become a global empire: it was the period when colonial systems centered in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Turkey collapsed, and new nations emerged throughout Africa and Asia. This class explores the changing strategies of military, economic, and political intervention that the US pursued as colonization lost legitimacy. Within that framework, the class invites students to think about four questions: How did the idea and practice of empire change over the twentieth century? How did the United States and people within the US relate to new visions of independence emerging in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? How did global interactions both inform and reflect racial ideology in the United States? Finally, how did anti-imperialist arguments and movements change over the twentieth century?",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Belief and Unbelief in Modern Thought,HIST 1250,Lecture,In Class,1,"""God is dead,"" declared Friedrich Nietzsche, ""and we have killed him."" Nietzche's words came as a climax of a longer history of criticism of, and dissent toward, the religious foundations of European society and politics. The critique of religion had vast implications for the meaning of human life, the nature of the person, and the conception of political and social existence. The course will explore the intensifying debate over religion in the intellectual history of Europe, reaching from the Renaissance, through the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment, to the twentieth century. Rousseau, Voltaire, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud. These thinkers allow us to trace the varieties of irreligious experience that have emerged in modern European thought and their implications for both historical and philosophical understanding. Rather than drawing a straight line from belief to non-belief, however, we will consider how religion may linger even in “secular” thought and culture; and we will develop something of an “encounter” between critics and defenders of religion, such as Soren Kierkegaard and Martin Buber, to see how religious discourse evolved in response to the challenges of skepticism.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Did the Treaty of Versailles or the Great Depression catapult the Nazis into power? What was the role of racism, of antisemitism? How did the regime consolidate itself? What was the role of ordinary people? How do we explain the Holocaust and what kind of a war was the Second World War? Grappling with these and more questions, the first half of the course focuses on Germany’s first democracy, the Weimar Republic and its vibrant political culture. In the second half, we study the Nazi regime, how it consolidated its power and remade society based on the concepts of race and struggle. Discussions of race and race-making are crucial throughout the course. In the name of “racial purity,” the Nazi state moved ruthlessly against Germany’s Jewish population, cleansed German society of all “undesirable” elements, and waged a brutal war of extermination that aimed to racially reorder all of Europe.

"History of Brazil: Slavery, Inequality, Development",HIST 1475,Lecture,In Class,1,"In the past decade, Brazil has emerged a leading global power. As the world's fifth-largest country, by size and population, and the ninth-largest by GDP, Brazil exerts tremendous influence on international politics and the global economy, seen in its position as an emerging BRIC nation and a regional heavyweight in South America. Brazil is often in the news for its strides in social welfare, leading investments in the Global South, as host of the World Cup and Olympics, and, most recently, for its political instability. It is also a nation of deep contradictions, in which myth of racial democracy -- the longstanding creed that Brazilian society has escaped racial discrimination -- functions alongside pervasive social inequality, state violence, political corruption, and an unforgiving penal system. This course examines six centuries of Brazilian history. It highlights the interplay between global events -- colonialism, slavery and emancipation, capitalism, and democratization -- and the local geographies, popular cultures, and social movements that have shaped this multi-ethnic and expansive nation. In particular, the readings will highlight Brazil's place in Latin America and the Lusophone World, as well as the ways in which Brazil stands as a counterpoint to the United States, especially in terms of the legacy of slavery and race relation. In this lecture, we will also follow the current political and economic crises unfolding in Brazil, at a moment when it has become all the more important to evaluate just how South America's largest nation has shaped and been shaped by global events.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

"Economic Histories of Modern South Asia, c. 1600 - Present",HIST 1560,Lecture,In Class,1,"Courses on the economic history of South Asia typically begin circa 1750, when European Company produced data series legible to economic historians first become available. This course departs from that trend, by beginning with the expansion of the Mughal empire and its deeply bureaucratized revenue system, along with the arrival of the British and Dutch East India Companies in the early seventeenth century. The course ends not in 1947 (with the decolonization of the subcontinent), but rather with the liberalization of independent national economies in the late twentieth century, which significantly altered the commercial landscape by permitting the entrance of foreign direct investment. We will analyze numerous economic and socio-political phenomena that played into commercial development and change across the subcontinent during this period, including: the organization and influence of colonial joint-stock companies; systems of land tenure; the role of ecology in affecting economic production and consumption; industrial growth and the rise of economic urbanism; labor organization and the significance of kinship and patronage; and the immense influence of the informal (i.e. “shadow” or “black”) economy, comprising some three-fourths of the South Asian labor force.

"Revolutionary Ideas, Ideologies of Revolution",HIST 1708,Lecture,In Class,1,"Ideas play an intangible role in defining culture and politics. Mass movements and revolutions have become a familiar feature of modern social activism and political life. This course surveys some of the major revolutions and ideologies that have caused significant change, beginning with revolutions of the 18th and early 19th centuries (American, French, Haitian) and then the rise of modern revolutions in Russia (Bolshevik), South Asia and Africa (anti-racist, decolonizing), and the Middle East (constitutional, anti-establishment, Islamic, gender). We will read and critique the writings of theorists of revolution (ex: John Locke, Karl Marx, Crane Brinton, Francois Furet). In addition, we will examine the icons of imperialism and consider varying sources of conflict within and between revolutionary states. Finally, we will assess artistic revolutions and determine how revolutionary changes in cinema, literature, and communication contribute to the realization of social upheavals. Novels, essays, films, classic texts, social media, and secondary works will comprise the bulk of the readings. The weekly assignments will focus on themes that show the nature of political change in various geographic settings to help students put the ideas of revolt and protest in the proper historical context.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in Intellectual History (AHCI)

Free Speech and Censorship,HIST 1733,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will explore the idea of free speech - its justification, its relationship to various forms of censorship, and its proper limits - as a historical, philosophical, legal, and ultimately, political question. In the first half of the course, we will explore the long history across the West of the regulation of various kinds of ideas and their expression, from malicious gossip to heresies, and read classic arguments for and against censorship, copyright protections, and standards of taste and decency and of truth. In the second part of the seminar, after looking at how the idea of freedom of speech came to seem an existential prerequisite for democracy as well as individual liberty, we will take up the historical and philosophical questions posed by such recent dilemmas as whether or not hate speech deserves the protection of the First Amendment, the distinction between art and pornography from the perspective of freedom of expression, speech during wartime, and the transformative effects of the internet on the circulation and regulation of ideas. We will end the semester by thinking about the globalization of the idea of free speech as a human right and its implications, both positive and negative. Readings will range from Robert Darnton's The Forbidden Best-Sellers of Pre-Revolutionary France, to D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover, to documents concerning the cartoons of Charlie Hebdo and law review articles about Citizens United v. FEC.

Did Common Sense really start the American Revolution? What does it mean to read Uncle Tom’s Cabin on a deck of playing cards? This course will investigate book histories, and the worlds of readers, writers, printers, publishers, and libraries in the Americas. It focuses on the colonial period through the nineteenth century, with a concluding look at the modern era. Each week we will look at books, newspapers, pamphlets, pictures, broadsides, or manuscripts—big and small, famous and forgotten. We will think about how books work, not just as texts but as cultural artifacts, and we learn to decode their languages, from title pages to typography to bindings. Our area of study is sometimes referred to as “book history,” and we will try to define this field together. We will examine sources now considered to be “literature” and those that tend to be more studied in “history,” and we won’t be particularly finicky about the differences. Our strategy is to introduce, each week, a range of topics and questions, including: * Colonization, missionization, and printing * Writing and revolution, printing and politics * Black and Indigenous print cultures * Gender, reading, and book history * Technology and change * Bookselling and marketing. The seminar will be held at the Kislak Center in Van Pelt Library and feature its rare book and manuscript collections. A number of seminar meetings will also be held at the Library Company of Philadelphia (1314 Locust Street), an extraordinary research library founded by Franklin in 1731.

These events and forces only begin to scratch the surface of the social, cultural, political, and economic transformations that remade American life in the 1970s and which, by 1975, forced President Gerald Ford to concede “that the state of the union is not good.” Beyond these familiar topics, this reading seminar will explore a range of developments that are crucial for understanding why the 1970s was perhaps the pivotal decade in making modern American politics, economics, and culture. Topics will include the fate of the Civil Rights movement and the war on crime; the rise and impact of second wave feminism; the rise of the modern conservative coalition (e.g., its religious, economic, and white working-class components); the emergence of the finance economy; the reorientation of organized labor and the remaking of the Democratic Party; the explosion of “therapeutic” cultures of self-help, individualism, and entrepreneurialism; and the rise of the Sunbelt as the nation’s dominant cultural, political, and economic region.",Not available,Not available,"HIST United States and Canada (AHUC)

Dialogue: Communicating Science and Knowledge from Socrates to Today (SNF Paideia Program Course),HIST 2208,Seminar,In Class,1,"From Socrates in the fourth century BCE to Galileo in the seventeenth, the dialogue—a form of writing that stages a conversation or debate between two or more speakers—was one of the most popular genres for disseminating observations and opinions about the world, particularly when they were new or controversial. Although scientists no longer use written dialogues to share their research today, discussion, disagreement, and debate remain important tools for advancing scientific knowledge, at least in theory if not always in practice. The aim of this course will be to explore how dialogue as a genre and a principal was and still is a critical tool not just for productively communicating scientific knowledge but also for developing and creating it. In the first part of the class, we will look at a range of ancient, medieval, and early modern scientific dialogues to understand better how and why premodern authors employed the genre to advance and share their opinions even as the nature of science changed dramatically over these periods. In the second part, we will explore scholarly works on the institutional, intellectual, and technological changes from the seventeenth century onwards that led to the dialogue falling by the wayside as a genre of scientific writing. We will look at the principles and practices that have emerged in its place and to what degree they have succeeded or not in creating authentic dialogue.

Russia's 20th-Century: History Through Literature,HIST 2257,Seminar,In Class,1,"To study Russia’s twentieth-century history through its literature is to come face-to-face with a country for which works of fiction have often served, as the writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn put it, as “a second government.” Russia is a society that takes literature seriously—one in which the pen is assumed to have direct historical consequences. In this course, we will study how twentieth-century Russian literature actively participated in war, revolution, totalitarian dictatorship, and resistance. The masterworks we will study open windows into worlds of revolutionary rapture and moral uplift in the face of tyranny, of history as a gigantic wheel that lifts some people up even as it crushes others. Our readings will range from an avant-garde play intended to rewire your mind, to an epic representation of revolutionary social transformation, to surreal and absurdist representations of a world gone mad.

Anticolonial Europe: An Intellectual and Cultural History,HIST 2259,Seminar,In Class,1,"Between 1919 and 1939, Europe – somewhat surprisingly – became a global hub of anticolonial thought. The leaders of future national liberation movements in India, Vietnam, and Algeria all converged in Europe’s metropolitan centers. This seminar investigates the intellectual and political creations that anti-imperial elites forged in Europe during this period. Focusing on the political networks that developed in Paris, London, Berlin, and Moscow, it evaluates how individuals from the Global South rethought and expanded the contents of Marxist-Leninist thought. It considers how they drew upon the principle of self-determination and, thereby, mobilized both Wilsonian and Leninist rhetoric. In addition to providing students with a foundation in anti-imperialism’s early twentieth-century histories, this course examines why Europe’s anticolonial revolution was so belated. To investigate this point, students investigate how intellectual traditions, including liberalism, socialism, and feminism, supported and were complicit in Europe’s imperial missions. **History Majors may write a 15-page research paper for this course to fulfill the major research requirement, with the permission of the instructor and their major advisor.**",Dr. Charlotte Kiechel is a fellow at the Wolf Humanities Center at Penn. https://www.charlottekiechel.com/,Not available,"HIST Concentration in European History (AHCE)

Each week or so, we will examine a different social group and its treatment by historians, as well as anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists, and novelists. Along the way, we will pay special attention to the question of sources: how can we recover the perspectives of people who rarely left their own accounts? How can we use documents and material objects—many of which were produced by colonial officials and elites—to access the experiences of the indigenous, the enslaved, and the poor? We will have some help approaching these questions from the knowledgeable staff at the Penn Museum, the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, and the Van Pelt Library.",Not available,Students with a semester level of Freshman may not enroll.,"HIST Concentration in World History (AHCW)

Cities in Chinese History,HIST 2501,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar will study the development of Chinese cities over the past two millennia with respect to their spatial structure, social constitution, economic system, political functions, and cultural representation (including cityscape paintings, maps, and films).As China transitioned from a collection of city-states to a united empire to nation state, Chinese urbanism underwent transformations as drastic as those of the country itself. Cities, which serve as a critical mechanism for the operation of a vast agrarian empire/nation like China , offer a unique vantage point for us to observe and analyze the continuities and discontinuities between dynastic empires as well as the radical transition from empire to modern nation state. Topics include: the city-state system in ancient China; the creation and evolution of imperial capitals; the medieval urban revolution and the subsequent collapse of classic city plans; the development of urban public sphere/public space in late imperial China; the rise of commercial power in urban politics; the negotiation of urban class and gender relations via cultural consumption; the role of cities in the building of a modern Chinese nation state; the anti-city experiment under the communist regime; urban citizenship in the reform era; as well as the expanding urbanization and shifting urbanism of Greater China as reflected in cinematic representations of Shanghai, Hongkong, and Taipei.",Not available,Not available,"EALC Chinese and Inner Asia (AEAN)

Travel Accounts and Atlantic Histories 1400-1800,HIST 2606,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course will focus on the boom in travel writing from 1400 to 1800, a period marked by sustained contact between Africa, Europe, and the Americas. However, rather than pursuing a traditional focus on authors as ‘explorers’ and ‘discoverers’, we will examine the ways in which such accounts can be used to tell a variety of histories, including those of Indigenous and local peoples around the Atlantic. What can travel narratives written primarily by European elites really tell us about the men, women and children they encountered along the west African coast? What do they have to teach us about the diverse groups inhabiting the Americas at this time: indigenous, enslaved, and formerly enslaved people as well as colonists? Incorporating book history and the study of material texts, the class will meet regularly in Kislak Special Collections to examine original travel accounts from the period and will also make use of the Common Press letterpress studio. It will ask students to think about the nature of travel writing, the concept of the ‘Other’, ideas of belonging, scientific discourses, the materiality of texts, and the ways in which the available archive shapes the histories we write.","This course fulfills the pre-1800 requirement for History Majors and Minors, but the attribute is currently missing in Path.

Taking Off: How Some Economies Get Rich,HIST 2733,Seminar,In Class,1,"What makes an economy grow? This question has been asked – and answered – many times over in the modern era. From Adam Smith’s classic Wealth of Nations (1776) to today’s political leaders, many have debated the ingredients necessary for a nation to prosper, or policies to promote growth. Some point to the need for fiscal responsibility, others an educated labor force, or to tariffs, natural resources, and the right laws. This seminar explores the deep history of this problem of economic growth. Students will read works by economists, social scientists, and historians that present different theories for why some nations develop faster than others. With case studies from across the globe, we will tackle topics like why Europe industrialized first, or the paradox of why the abundance of natural resources does not necessarily contribute to long-lasting economic development. This course also asks students to think critically about the metrics used to measure “success” and “failure” across nations, as well as how such comparisons between societies have been mobilized to legitimize imperial expansion, human exploitation, environmental destruction, or political repression. By discussing how governments, corporate interests, and individual actors have implemented strategies to increase national wealth, students will also be asked to grapple with some of the consequences of economic growth for the environment, human welfare, and social inequality.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in Economic History (AHCC)

"Conversion in Historical Perspective: Religion, Society, and Self",HIST 3203,Seminar,In Class,1,"Changes of faith are complex shifts that involve social, spiritual, intellectual, and even physical alterations. In the premodern West, when legal status was often determined by religious affiliation and the state of one’s soul was a deathly serious matter, such changes were even more fraught. What led a person to undertake an essential transformation of identity that could affect everything from food to family to spiritual fulfillment? Whether we are speaking of individual conversions of conscience or the coerced conversions of whole peoples en masse, religious change has been central to the global development and spread of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and reveals much about the people and contexts in which it took place. This seminar will explore the dynamics of conversion across a range of medieval and early modern contexts. We will investigate the motivations for conversions, the obstacles faced by converts, and the issues raised by conversion from the perspective of those who remained within a single tradition. How did conversion efforts serve globalization and empire, and what other power relations were involved? How did peoplehood, nationality, or race play out in conversion and its aftermath? How did premodern people understand conversion differently from each other, and differently than their coreligionists or scholars do today? The course will treat a number of specific examples, including autobiographical conversion narratives and conversion manuals, the role ascribed to conversion in visions of messianic redemption, forced conversions under Spanish and Ottoman rule, missionizing in the age of European expansion, and more. The course aims to hone students’ skills in thinking about—and with—premodern religiosity, opening up new perspectives on the past and present by reading primary texts and analytical research.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in European History (AHCE)

The ""long 19th century""(1789-1914) was simply the most dynamic in history. Europe was transformed by technological, political, and ideological revolutions, and the rest of the world was transformed by Europe’s imperialism and trade. Yet, no general wars erupted over that century thanks to the sturdy pillars of peace raised by the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna. Over time, however, the pillars crumbled and human folly, combined with the impersonal forces of modernity, pushed Europe into the world wars and holocausts of the hideous 20th century.

Why Medical Interventions Work or Fail: A Search for Answers,HSOC 0343,Seminar,In Class,1,"The past is littered with interventions that worked or were thought to work that we hold in little regard today – from frontal lobotomies to bone marrow transplants for metastatic breast cancer. Since 1962 the FDA requires proof of efficacy for new drugs. Yet uncertainty surrounds the efficacy and safety of many drugs, technologies, and practices in use today. Will some future observer of today’s practices wonder, as we do about the bleeding and purging of traditional medicine, why we do the things we do? This course will go deep into the social history of modern Western biomedicine to make sense of the ideological, economic, technical, scientific, and social forces shaping the modern medical interventions and the work they do. Students will be introduced to the rewards and challenges of studying medicine as a social and historical process. Case studies of the efficacy of contemporary biomedical interventions will be enriched by in-class meetings with prominent social scientists, biomedical researchers, and clinicians, as well as some potential visits to clinics and historical sites. Each student will develop a research project or essay review related to the efficacy of medical interventions. Most students will likely explore a current or historical controversy over the efficacy and safety of a particular intervention.

It focuses on three parts of the world Europeans colonized: Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. Today's healing practices in these regions grew out of the interaction between the medical traditions of the colonized and those of the European colonizers. We therefore explore the nature of the interactions. What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? What were the effects of colonial racial and gender hierarchies on medical practice? How did practitioners of ""non-Western"" medicine carve out places for themselves? How did they redefine ancient traditions? How did patients find their way among multiple therapeutic traditions? How does biomedicine take a different shape when it is practiced under conditions of poverty, or of inequalities in power? How do today's medical problems grow out of this history? This is a fascinating history of race and gender, of pathogens and conquerors, of science and the body.

American Health Policy,HSOC 1411,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"""American Health Policy"" places the success or failure of specific pieces of U.S. health care legislation into social and political context. The course covers the time period from the U.S. Civil War to the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA), addressing two central questions: 1) Why was the United States one of the only industrialized nations to, until recently, have a private, non-nationalized, non-federalized health care system? 2) Why has U.S. health insurance historically been a benefit given through places of employment? Some topics addressed include: private health insurance, industrial health and workmen's compensation, the welfare state (in Europe, Canada, and the U.S.), maternal and infant care programs, Medicare and Medicaid. One of the main take-home messages of the course is that 20th-century U.S. health care policies both reflected and shaped American social relations based on race, class, gender, and age. This course is a combination lecture and ""SAIL"" class. SAIL stands for ""Structured, Active, In-Class Learning."" During many class periods, students will work in small groups on a specific exercise, followed by a large group discussion and/or brief lecture.

Trauma and Healing in Historical Perspective,HSOC 2227,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course considers the diverse range of theories and topics related to trauma in the 20th and 21st centuries, looking to understand how trauma has been mobilized at different moments in history for political, social, and personal ends. The point of the course is not to simply support or deny trauma as an interpretive framework for human pain and suffering, but instead to look critically at how it emerged as an object of study for medical and scientific circles and the benefits and ramifications of those biomedical frameworks that were felt at the time and stay with us into the present. We also consider how trauma has been taken up by actors outside of medicine and science, including popular media, fiction and activist communities. Using frameworks from feminist science studies, disability studies, black studies and queer studies, alongside more traditional histories of psychiatry, medicine and technology, students think about such diverse topics as sexual violence, racial violence, domestic and familial abuse, theories of psychological development, memory and trust, citizenship, the criminal justice system, the effects of our environments, intergenerational effects of violence, embodiment, biomedical models of risk and disease and narratives of the self. At the heart of this course is an interest in how we should understand humans’ capacity to harm and be harmed by one another, and how we can attend to the enduring effects of inequality and structural violence while remaining firmly grounded in the day-to-day lived, felt realities of violence and interpersonal harm.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"HSOC Major Related (AHSM)

We pay special attention to slavery’s economic, environmental, and human costs, as we investigate the development of the medical profession and the acquisition of formal and informal medical knowledge in this epoch. Beyond that, we will investigate how perceptions of disease susceptibility and overall experiences with specific illnesses proceeded along raced and gendered lines.

There may also be no more ubiquitous diagnosis in our current moment. As prevalence rates have soared to one out of every 36 children affected, it seems as if everyone is touched by autism in some capacity -- although a personal connection to autism is not at all required for this course. This class will cover the history of autism, from its introduction in 1943 to the present -- a trajectory that intersects with the histories of medicine, psychiatry, and disability. We will also explore the divisive issues fracturing the autism community right now, including the rise of Neurodiversity, inclusion, impairment, caregiving, representation, and even the very words we use to discuss those on the spectrum.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,HSOC Major Related (AHSM),MW 10:15am-11:44am (8/27 to 12/9),Amy Lutz,,,,,,,,[1.0]
Manufacturing Minds: From Babbage to ChatGPT,HSOC 2421,Lecture,In Class,1,"When asked to tell its own history, ChatGPT answers literally, describing (vaguely of course) its own training data set. When pressed to describe the longer history of “technology like you,” it mentions early computer science, programs that played chess or solved math problems, before naming deep learning algorithms and big data as the key breakthroughs. This lineage is not untrue, but it ignores the wider context in which individuals and organizations have come to pursue this strange dream of crafting an intelligent object. As an uncannily lucid conversation partner who freely performs all manner of textual tasks, ChatGPT participates in a longstanding tension in the history of information technology between the goals of manufacturing minds and making mindless clerical workers. In this course we historicize that tension in three domains—calculation, knowledge work, and games—all of which directly inform our efforts to imagine what ChatGPT and its ilk might be. Throughout, we will attend to the ways machinery shaped specific tasks’ construction in relation to gender, race, and class identities. We will see how technologies often imagined as disembodied are always material, interacting with human bodies and physical environments.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"HSOC Disease and Culture (AHSD)

Normal People,HSOC 3028,Seminar,In Class,1,"For most of us, what’s normal feels downright natural. The normal is our baseline, invisible and unconsidered until something abnormal draws our attention to it. But a little prodding shows the contradictions within bland, boring normality: it’s defined by our internal feelings as much as by quantified standards, it describes individuals as well as populations, and it is intensely difficult to describe on its own merits without comparison. So what does it mean to be normal, anyway? This seminar examines “the normal” as a medical and scientific concept from the Renaissance until today. Has the concept of normal always existed? What makes a person or body normal? How has such a thing been assessed? Can the normal exist without deviance – and is this relationship inherently one about power? We will examine how scientific ideas of “the normal” – and its conflation with “the natural” – shaped medical knowledge and ideologies about racial difference, sex and gender, socioeconomic class, anatomical difference and disability, and human behavior. How have the “normals” of the past shaped our current scientific understandings of ourselves and the people around us? Our goal will be to make visible the ways that “normal” gets normalized in order to deepen our critical engagement with modern medicine, wellness culture, and racial and gender politics.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"HSOC Disease and Culture (AHSD)

Technology and Medicine in Modern America,HSOC 4427,Seminar,In Class,1,"Medicine as it exists in the United States today is profoundly technological. Many folks residing in the U.S. regard it as perfectly normal for clinicians to examine patients with instruments, for specialists to expose people’s bodies to many different machines, and for those machines to produce data that is mechanically/electronically processed, interpreted and stored. People are billed technologically, prompted to attend appointments technologically, and buy everyday consumer technologies to protect, diagnose, or improve our health. (Consider, for example, air-purifiers, heart rate monitors, pregnancy testing kits, blood-sugar monitoring tests, and thermometers.) Yet even at the beginning of the twentieth century, devices such as these were scarce and infrequently used by American physicians and medical consumers alike. Over the course of this semester, we examine how “technology” came to medicine’s center-stage in the U.S., and what impact this change has had on medical practice, institutions, and consumers alike. Technology & Medicine in Modern America fulfills the Capstone research requirement for the HSOC major. Students develop and execute original research projects connected to our course questions and themes. Student topics can be wildly diverse and reflect their own interests and concentration: reproductive technologies, technology & disability, pharma & biotech, public health tech, medicalized consumers/”everyday” med tech, technology & enhancement, med tech & the military, and so on. By the end of the course, students will have honed their skills in primary and secondary source research and in constructing an academic argument and paper. Assignments. Students formulate a research question; appropriately situate their question within the literature of a core STSC/HSOC discipline (anthropology, sociology, or history); and build an argument (an answer to their research question) based on their analysis of primary sources.

Will be required for, and limited to, incoming students in the Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business, which is a coordinated dual-degree program jointly administered by the College of Arts and Sciences and the Wharton School. The course is being offered for the first time in Fall 2020 and will be co-taught by the Huntsman Faculty Directors, Professor Rudra Sil (Department of Political Science, School of Arts & Sciences) and Professor Harbir Singh (Management Department, Wharton School). The course offers a shared understanding of some fundamental concepts, theoretical frameworks, and long-term historical trends that relate to both the study of business on a global scale and the social scientific analysis of contemporary issues. The first section (module) of the course, to be led by Professor Sil, will provide a broad overview of the evolution of global political economy across diverse historical eras, from the Industrial Revolution to the challenges of economic governance in the post-World War II era to the emergence of (and questioning of) the ""Washington Consensus"" in the post-Cold War era. Throughout, students will learn about varied developmental pressures and shifting international environments within which the relationships between markets and governments have been organized. The second section (module), to be led by Professor Singh, will delve into the complex challenges and opportunities faced by firms and businesses operating on a global scale. With the aid of case studies, this section will address approaches to decisions and processes that affect the rise and fall of comparative advantage, while paying attention to evolving organizational structures, business strategies, the emergence of inter-firm networks and large business organizations, including multi-national corporations. In the third part of the course, students are expected to use what they learn and engage each other through the presentation of team projects on a major contemporary issue of global significance. These projects will incorporate discussion of some of the research being done by Penn faculty in the School of Arts & Sciences as well as the Wharton School, thereby helping to familiarize students with some of the disciplines and scholarly traditions covered in the two schools.

Needfinding,IPD 5090,Lecture,In Class,1,"Needfinding is an approach that puts people and their needs at the center of product development and business strategy creation. Over 90% of new products introduced into the marketplace fail. A good portion of these failures are due to lack of understanding of end consumers and their needs. To develop truly successful new products, it's not enough just to ask people what they need or want. Designers and engineers need tools and techniques to get beyond what people can explicitly state and determine their implicit needs. Needfinding is an approach for developing deep insights that provide strategic direction for corporations and open up new possibilities for product development. In this class students will gain a toolset from which to develop their own approaches to conducting researching for design: learning how to think about other people, about culture, and about new perspectives. They will also learn tactical skills: how to define research questions, how to conduct observations and interviews, how to interpret results, how to synthesize them into fodder for design, and how to communicate their findings in a way that is compelling and actionable for designers, marketers, and business strategists.

The goal of the studio is to give students a firsthand experience of various processes involved in creating successful integrated product designs. This first semester of the four-semester studio sequence focuses on giving students experience developing designs based on a range of starting points: form, function, materiality and manufacturing process. Students will practice design through rigorous, consistent processes for thinking through the evolution of their ideas. In this course, they will go through an entire design process from conceptualization to design to producing prototypes. They will be taught to focus on the specifics of their designs, causing them to be conscious of what drives their choices as designers and providing them with a wider range of tools to design from in successive projects. Course work will involve readings, assignments, class participation, in-class exercises, a mid-term presentation and a final submission.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to students with a major in Integrated Product Design.,MSSE Elective (EMME),Varies by section,Varies by section,2.6,2.9,2.9,2.5,,,,

"Conversion in Historical Perspective: Religion, Society, and Self",JWST 3207,Seminar,In Class,1,"Changes of faith are complex shifts that involve social, spiritual, intellectual, and even physical alterations. In the premodern West, when legal status was often determined by religious affiliation and the state of one’s soul was a deathly serious matter, such changes were even more fraught. What led a person to undertake an essential transformation of identity that could affect everything from food to family to spiritual fulfillment? Whether we are speaking of individual conversions of conscience or the coerced conversions of whole peoples en masse, religious change has been central to the global development and spread of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and reveals much about the people and contexts in which it took place. This seminar will explore the dynamics of conversion across a range of medieval and early modern contexts. We will investigate the motivations for conversions, the obstacles faced by converts, and the issues raised by conversion from the perspective of those who remained within a single tradition. How did conversion efforts serve globalization and empire, and what other power relations were involved? How did peoplehood, nationality, or race play out in conversion and its aftermath? How did premodern people understand conversion differently from each other, and differently than their coreligionists or scholars do today? The course will treat a number of specific examples, including autobiographical conversion narratives and conversion manuals, the role ascribed to conversion in visions of messianic redemption, forced conversions under Spanish and Ottoman rule, missionizing in the age of European expansion, and more. The course aims to hone students’ skills in thinking about—and with—premodern religiosity, opening up new perspectives on the past and present by reading primary texts and analytical research.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in European History (AHCE)

US Empire in the Twentieth Century,LALS 1191,Lecture,In Class,1,"This class examines the emergence of the U.S. as a world power since 1898, and considers both the international and domestic consequences of U.S. foreign relations. In one respect, the twentieth century was a strange time to become a global empire: it was the period when colonial systems centered in Europe, Russia, Japan, and Turkey collapsed, and new nations emerged throughout Africa and Asia. This class explores the changing strategies of military, economic, and political intervention that the US pursued as colonization lost legitimacy. Within that framework, the class invites students to think about four questions: How did the idea and practice of empire change over the twentieth century? How did the United States and people within the US relate to new visions of independence emerging in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? How did global interactions both inform and reflect racial ideology in the United States? Finally, how did anti-imperialist arguments and movements change over the twentieth century?",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in Diplomatic History (AHCD)

"History of Brazil: Slavery, Inequality, Development",LALS 1475,Lecture,In Class,1,"In the past decade, Brazil has emerged a leading global power. As the world's fifth-largest country, by size and population, and the ninth-largest by GDP, Brazil exerts tremendous influence on international politics and the global economy, seen in its position as an emerging BRIC nation and a regional heavyweight in South America. Brazil is often in the news for its strides in social welfare, leading investments in the Global South, as host of the World Cup and Olympics, and, most recently, for its political instability. It is also a nation of deep contradictions, in which myth of racial democracy -- the longstanding creed that Brazilian society has escaped racial discrimination -- functions alongside pervasive social inequality, state violence, political corruption, and an unforgiving penal system. This course examines six centuries of Brazilian history. It highlights the interplay between global events -- colonialism, slavery and emancipation, capitalism, and democratization -- and the local geographies, popular cultures, and social movements that have shaped this multi-ethnic and expansive nation. In particular, the readings will highlight Brazil's place in Latin America and the Lusophone World, as well as the ways in which Brazil stands as a counterpoint to the United States, especially in terms of the legacy of slavery and race relation. In this lecture, we will also follow the current political and economic crises unfolding in Brazil, at a moment when it has become all the more important to evaluate just how South America's largest nation has shaped and been shaped by global events.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Each week or so, we will examine a different social group and its treatment by historians, as well as anthropologists, archaeologists, sociologists, and novelists. Along the way, we will pay special attention to the question of sources: how can we recover the perspectives of people who rarely left their own accounts? How can we use documents and material objects—many of which were produced by colonial officials and elites—to access the experiences of the indigenous, the enslaved, and the poor? We will have some help approaching these questions from the knowledgeable staff at the Penn Museum, the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts, and the Van Pelt Library.",Not available,Not available,"HIST Concentration in World History (AHCW)

The decipherment of Maya script and advances in archaeological techniques, including aerial LiDAR scanning and isotopic analysis, are combining with art historical and literary sources to transform our understanding of a culture that ranks among the most famous, but enigmatic, on this continent. The ability to read Maya inscriptions has created the first historical archaeology for the ancient Americas, giving access to an Indigenous voice that has been silent for more than a millennium—with implications not only for scholarship but for the efforts of descendent peoples in asserting a modern Maya identity with existing Latin American states.

Within this course, students will instead focus their writing on class, whether that be on the middle classes, the bourgeoisie, ruling class, or the world’s majority: the working class. Work on class can take the form of satire or solidarity; expose conflict and antagonism between and within a given class; historicize individual relationships within the history of property relations; focus on finances, wealth, or poverty; portray class ascent or descent. Writing may be in any genre: poetry, fiction, memoir, political essay, film script, play or performance.

Black Political Thought: Difference And Community,LALS 6550,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course is designed to familiarize graduate students with some of the key texts and debates in Africana Studies concerning the relationship between racial slavery, modernity and politics. Beginning with the Haitian Revolution, much of black political thought (thinking and doing politics) has advocated group solidarity and cohesion in the face of often overwhelming conditions of servitude, enslavement and coercion within the political economy of slavery and the moral economy of white supremacy. Ideas and practices of freedom however, articulated by political actors and intellectuals alike, have been as varied as the routes to freedom itself. Thus, ideas and practices of liberty, citizenship and political community within many African and Afro-descendant communities have revealed multiple, often competing forms of political imagination. The multiple and varied forms of political imagination, represented in the writings of thinkers like Eric Williams, Richard Wright, Carole Boyce Davies and others, complicates any understanding of black political thought as having a single origin, genealogy or objective. Students will engage these and other authors in an effort to track black political thought's consonance and dissonance with Western feminisms, Marxism, nationalism and related phenomena and ideologies of the 20th and now 21st century.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

Afro-Latin America,LALS 6971,Seminar,In Class,1,"In-depth analysis of the black experience in Latin America and the Spanish, French and English-speaking Caribbean, since slavery to the present. The course opens with a general examination of the existence of Afro-descendants in the Americas, through the study of fundamental historical, political and sociocultural processes. This panoramic view provides the basic tools for the scrutiny of a broad selection of literary, musical, visual, performance, and cinematic works, which leads to the comprehension of the different ethical-aesthetic strategies used to express the Afro-diasporic experience. Essential concepts such as negritude, creolite, and mestizaje, as well as the most relevant theories on identity and identification in Latin America and the Caribbean, will be thoroughly examined, in articulation with the interpretation of artistic works. Power, nationalism, citizenship, violence, religious beliefs, family and community structures, migration, motherhood and fatherhood, national and gender identities, eroticism, and sexuality are some of the main issues discussed un this seminar.",Not available,Not available,"COL Instruction: Non-English (AUOT)

Workshop I: Ecology and Built Landscapes,LARP 5110,Lecture,In Class,1,"This workshop explores a sequence of sites extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Appalachian Mountains that illustrates the changing geology and topography of the regional physiographic provinces including the Atlantic Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and Valley and Ridge. In moving westward along the transect, field trips to natural areas and constructed sites will highlight the diversity of regional plant communities ranging from primary dune to salt marsh, serpentine Virginia pine-oak forest to seepage wetland, and more. Analysis of the inter-connections between the underlying geology, topography, hydrology, soils, vegetation, wildlife, and human interventions will reveal patterns reflecting process and demonstrate key ecological and cultural systems and processes through the production of field notebooks as well as large-scale measured drawings. Ultimately students will develop a vocabulary (recognition, identification and nomenclature) of the materials of landscape, its substance, its ecology, and its changing nature owing to place and time.

Workshop II: Landform and Planting Design Plants Audit,LARP 5130,Lecture,In Class,0,"Workshop II combines two of the most elemental tools in the practice of landscape architecture: landform and planting design. Grading - the shaping and sculpting of the landform - is both art and science, and thus Workshop II aims to provide an appreciation of landform as an evocative component in the design vocabulary as well as a critical tool in solving difficult design problems. The basic techniques and strategies of grading design (slopes, terraces, water management, grade change devices) will be introduced, practiced and reinforced, so that grading design becomes an integral part of the students' design approach. Lecture, field trips, modeling, in-class exercises, and group projects will be used. The Planting component provides students with a working overview of the principles and processes of planting design. Plants will be considered both as individual elements and as part of larger dynamic systems. The natural distribution of plants, concepts of plant community and successional patterns, and the relationship of planting an topography will be used as the initial framework for planting design. Planting design typologies will be examined as an outgrowth of these ""natural"" patterns. The role of plants as a key element in the structural design of the landscape will be explored through a combination of modeling, plan and section drawing, temporal studies, writing, field trips and case studies. Emphasis will be placed on process and evolution: the temporality of planting (daily, seasonal and annual changes), establishment and maintenance of plantings, and the process of planting design. During the first week of May, a five-day field ecology course focuses on techniques of urban revitalization, sustainable land use, reclamation, and restoration. The field trips offer insight into the diversity of approaches to using plants to promote positive environmental change.",Not available,Enrollment limited to students in a Master of Landscape Architect degree.,Not available,T 10:15am-1:14pm (8/27 to 12/9),Patricia West,,,,,,,,[0.0]

Theory I: Histories and Theories of Landscape and Environment,LARP 5350,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course introduces students to relevant topics, themes, and sites that help us understand the conception, production, evolution, and reception of designed and found landscapes throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It aims at building an understanding of landscapes as both physical spaces and as cultural media and constructions that sit at the nexus between art and science and that contribute knowledge about humankind's relationship with non-human nature. Landscapes are the result of social, political, artistic and intellectual endeavors. The topography, soil and climate of a site also condition its design, use and habitation. As much as designed and found landscapes are a product of their time, they have also contributed to shaping history, both through their physical materiality and through the mental worlds they enable. Embedding found and designed landscapes into their social, political and cultural contexts, the course also pays close attention to the role of expert knowledge and the professions that have contributed to creating them. The course explores the various tensions and relationships embodied, created and represented by designed landscapes; the tensions between nature and culture, practice and use, design and reception, the visual reception of landscapes and their inhabitation, and site-specificity and purposefully ""international"" design expressions. Using a variety of sources including texts, illustrations, and film the course offers insights into the development and transfer of ideas between different cultures, countries and geographical regions, and time periods.",Not available,"Enrollment is limited to students with a program in Landscape Studies, Landscape Arch & Regl Plng or Landscape Arch & Regl Plng.",Not available,Varies by section,Not available,2.2,2.2,2.2,2.7,,,,

Studio problems are ""live"" - local leaders and experts are actively trying to solve them, there is an audience for student work outside the University, and projects have the potential to stimulate debate and new directions. The Green Stimuli studio takes on design problems where soil, terrain, geology, mineral resources, climate, water, plants, wildlife, and living systems interactions are major drivers. Studio projects explore one or more of these dimensions in depth to reach high levels of design exploration, strategic thinking, technical resolution and physical expression. The studio's topics intersect with a broader universe of practical concerns, including land use, local and regional economies, real estate development and public policy, as well as philosophical and artistic questions about nature and ecology.

This elusive quality of landscapes – the element of surprise – while being a discomfort at times, is also what makes it exciting to engage, transform, and occupy landscapes. Prevalent trends in representing landscapes by hand drawings or digital media in design practices tend to push elusiveness ‘behind the scenes’ and are often prescriptive. Traditional design interventions that follow these representations sometimes cannot accommodate the unexpected or engage the genuinely dynamic. The result can be catastrophic – floods, riots, encroachments, etc., or, at the very least, landscapes that lack the agility and spontaneity necessary to negotiate the increasing fluidities of open economies and ecologies. In this course, we will consider themes and processes that cultivate what we will refer to as a watery imagination. We will explore techniques in printmaking, as well as alternative material-based approaches to engage time and materiality in landscapes. Rather than pictorial depiction, our interest will be in observing processes of transformation in the field and engaging printmaking processes in the studio in an analogous relationship. We will move towards the iterative and serial rather than produce singular pieces of work. We will simultaneously work between observation and negotiation of chance events and the calibrated deployment of known transformation processes to construct productive dialogues around the making, experiencing, inhabiting, visualizing, and reimagining landscape.",Enrollment limited to students in the Weitzman School Graduate or Weitzman School Professional divisions.,DSGN Design Masters LARP Elective (FMLA),T 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),Matthew Neff,,,,,,,LARP 5010 OR LARP 5330 OR LARP 6010 OR ARCH 5010 OR ARCH 5320 OR ARCH 6010,[1.0]

This covers the bodies of law that make up the core of health law. It covers the law concerning relationships between doctors and patients, the governance and regulation of hospitals, and the finance and governance of the health system. The course covers each of these areas of law in sufficient depth and breadth to enable participants to develop a legal framework for analyzing relationships between stakeholders in the health system. This course analyzes processes by which each of the areas of law support and regulate the health system in two ways. Firstly, it focuses on the processes by which legislators, courts, administrative decision-makers create legal and regulatory frameworks that support the health care system. Secondly, it focuses on the processes by which these legal actors use the law to influence the outcomes produced by the health care system.

"Other People's Money: The Law, Politics, and History of Financial Institutions",LGST 2430,Lecture,In Class,1,"We learn in introductory economics courses that money is fungible: that is, one dollar is as good as the next. Indeed, using money as a ""medium of exchange"" is one of its defining characteristics. But what happens when we take a big pile of money and put it in different buckets. On one bucket we might write ""hedge fund""; on another, ""central bank""; on still another, ""payday lender."" Then money starts to change in ways defined by law, history, ethics, and politics. This course will take you on a tour of these different buckets--different kinds of financial institutions, broadly defined--throughout the modern financial system. We will look at hedge funds, insurance companies, investment banks, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, consumer banks, payday lenders, state-sponsored enterprises (like the Export-Import Bank in the United States and much of the financial system in China), and the cutting edge of fintech, including crowd-funded lending, digital currencies, and more. In each case, students will be exposed to a series of specialized questions: Where did this institution come from? What problem is it trying to solve that other alternatives could not resolve? What is the basic business (or, where relevant, regulatory) model for each institution? How is each institution regulated, and by whom? What are the ethical considerations in each context?

"Business, Social Responsibility, and the Environment",LGST 6130,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This half-credit (.5 cu) course presents students with the opportunity to explore an alternative perspective to what some might consider the traditional or standard model of business. A starting point of the course is to ask whether business firms owe a “social responsibility” that includes, but goes beyond, maximizing profits. The course begins with overarching questions including to whom a business firm owes legal and ethical duties, how to balance or trade-off obligations owed to different stakeholders when they may conflict, and how to consider the distributional and other socially important implications of business decisions. Different sections of this course will examine questions about the responsibility of business toward a number of pressing environmental and social issues, including for example, climate change, fresh water availability, green marketing claims, democratic values, racial and gender diversity, human rights, poverty reduction, and global health issues such as access to medicine. These topics will be treated primarily through the lenses of law and ethics. Please consult individual instructors’ syllabi in the Wharton syllabus repository for further details on what will be covered in each individual section, and please note that topics change over time and in response to student and faculty interests.

Proto-Indo European Language and Society,LING 0051,Seminar,In Class,1,"Most of the languages now spoken in Europe, along with some languages of Iran, India and central Asia, are thought to be descended from a single language known as Proto-Indo-European, spoken at least six thousand years ago, probably in a region extending from north of the Black Sea in modern Ukraine east through southern Russia. Speakers of Proto-Indo-European eventually populated Europe in the Bronze Age, and their societies formed the basis of the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, as well as of the Celtic, Germanic and Slavic speaking peoples. What were the Proto-Indo-Europeans like? What did they believe about the world and their gods? How do we know? Reconstruction of the Proto-Indo-European language, one of the triumphs of comparative and historical linguistics in the 19th and 20th centuries, allows us a glimpse into the society of this prehistoric people. In this seminar students will, through comparison of modern and ancient languages, learn the basis of this reconstruction -- the comparative method of historical linguistics -- as well as explore the culture and society of the Proto-Indo-Europeans and their immediate descendants. In addition, we will examine the pseudo-scientific basis of the myth of Aryan supremacy, and study the contributions of archaeological findings in determining the ""homeland"" of the Indo-Europeans. No prior knowledge of any particular language is necessary.

Language games and cultural evolution,LING 2190,Seminar,In Class,1,"This is a course about how language and communication can be thought of as games.

These actions might achieve goals, and they might prompt further actions, and so on. Perhaps more interestingly, these communicative actions can, over time, lead to changes in the environment and even the rules of the game itself. In other words, the playing field changes dynamically as a result of the actions performed on it. This way of looking at language is not new, and this is also a course about how thinking about language this way can inspire (and has inspired) formal models and laboratory experiments that help us to understand how humans use language and how it evolves.

Introduction to the Ancient Middle East,MELC 0001,Lecture,In Class,1,"The great pyramids and mysterious mummies of Egypt, the fabled Tower of Babel, and the laws of the Babylonian king Hammurabi are some of the things that might come to mind when you think of the ancient Middle East. Yet these are only a very few of the many fascinating -- and at time perplexing -- aspects of the civilizations that flourished there c. 3300-300 BCE. This is where writing first developed, where people thought that the gods wrote down what would happen in the future on the lungs and livers of sacrificed sheep, and where people knew how to determine the length of hypotenuse a thousand years before the Greek Pythagoras was born. During this course, we will learn more about these other matters and discover their place in the cultures and civilizations of that area. This is an interdisciplinary survey of the history, society and culture of the ancient Middle East, in particular Egypt and Mesopotamia, utilizing extensive readings from ancient texts in translation (including the Epic of Gilgamesh, ""one of the great masterpieces of world literature""), but also making use of archaeological and art historical materials. The goal of the course is to gain an appreciation of the various societies of the time, to understand some of their great achievements, to become acquainted with some of the fascinating individuals of the time (such as Hatshepsut, ""the women pharaoh,"" and Akhenaten, ""the heretic king""), and to appreciate the rich heritage that they have left us.",Not available,Graduate/Research level students may not enroll.,"ANCH Ancient & Premod Hist Related Crs Other Dept (AANP)

"Warriors, Concubines & Converts: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East & Europe",MELC 0450,Lecture,In Class,1,"For almost six hundred years, the Ottomans ruled most of the Balkans and the Middle East. From their bases in Anatolia, Ottoman armies advanced into the Balkans, Syria, Egypt, and Iraq, constantly challenging the borders of neighboring European and Islamicate empires. By the end of the seventeenth century, Constantinople, Jerusalem, Cairo, Baghdad, Sarajevo, Budapest, and nearly Vienna came under Ottoman rule. As the empire expanded into Europe and the Middle East, the balance of imperial power shifted from warriors to converts, concubines, and intellectuals. This course examines the expansion of the Ottoman sultanate from a local principality into a sprawling empire with a sophisticated bureaucracy; it also investigates the social, cultural, and intellectual developments that accompanied the long arc of the empire's rise and fall. By the end of the course, students will be able to identify and discuss major currents of change in the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East.

Narrative Across Cultures,MELC 1960,Lecture,In Class,1,"The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.","How does literature both connect cultures across time and space and speak about what is specific to each culture? In this course we will read several types of stories written in different periods and in different parts of the world, ranging from classical Greek and Sanskrit drama to modern African, European, American and Asian novels. Many of these texts are very well known, have had long afterlives, and have been adapted and rewritten in distant spaces and times. In some cases, we will engage with these retellings. Others directly embody the coming together or friction between cultures and peoples. By studying them, we can reflect on how literary texts reflect the cultures in which they were produced and have a capacity to travel across cultures.",Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Worlds of Late Antiquity,MELC 6080,Seminar,In Class,1,"The period between the third and eighth centuries - from the Tetrarchy led by Diocletian to the rise of Umayyad Caliphate - is characteristically regarded as a period of ferment and change, whether that be on the still-influential model of Decline and Fall first proposed by Edward Gibbon in the eighteenth century or the somewhat less deterministic account of transformation favored by Peter Brown in the late twentieth. These narratives tend to emphasize the large-scale processes that played out over these centuries, such as the florescence and fragmentation of two world empires; the emergence of two highly influential monotheistic religions of the book; and the codification of legal systems that continue to dominate contemporary practices and theories of law. Equally, what characterizes these centuries is the particular granularity and character of the textual and archaeological evidence that exists for the functioning of this world at the micro-scale, as against the periods that preceded and followed. This course traces the social, economic, cultural, and religious institutions and processes that make this period distinctive, explores the nature of the evidence for those institutions and processes, and exposes to scrutiny the assumptions and preconceptions that underpin the scholarly narratives that have been constructed about them.",Not available,Undergraduate level students may not enroll.,Not available,T 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),"Kimberly Bowes

Introduction To Management,MGMT 1010,Lecture,In Class,0,"We all spend much of our lives in organizations. Most of us are born in organizations, educated in organizations, and work in organizations. Organizations emerge because individuals can't (or don't want to) accomplish their goals alone. Management is the art and science of helping individuals achieve their goals together. Managers in an organization determine where their organization is going and how it gets there. More formally, managers formulate strategies and implement those strategies. This course provides a framework for understanding the opportunities and challenges involved in formulating and implementing strategies by taking a ""system"" view of organizations,which means that we examine multiple aspects of how managers address their environments, strategy, structure, culture, tasks, people, and outputs, and how managerial decisions made in these various domains interrelate. The course will help you to understand and analyze how managers can formulate and implement strategies effectively. It will be particularly valuable if you are interested in management consulting, investment analysis, or entrepreneurship - but it will help you to better understand and be a more effective contributor to any organizations you join, whether they are large, established firms or startups.

Social Entrepreneurship,MGMT 2120,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This is a course on creating a business to attack a social problem and thereby accomplish both social impact and financial sustainability. For this course, social entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship used to profitably confront social problems. This definition therefore views social entrepreneurship as a distinct alternative to public sector initiatives. The basic thesis is that many social problems, if looked at through an entrepreneurial lens, create opportunity for someone to launch a venture that generates profits by alleviating that social problem. This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing, the more the profits made, the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise, the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity. Creating a profitable social entrepreneurship venture is by no means a simple challenge. Cross-listed with MGMT 812.","Attendance at first day is mandatory.

Work and Technology: Choices and Outcomes,MGMT 2430,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"That technology affects work is a commonplace - but we accept technology’s impact too readily as inevitable and unchangeable. This 0.5 CU course challenges the mindset of technological determinism and explores what choice points are available to managers implementing new technologies as well as the engineers who design them. • Module 1: “Technology and Its Impact on Jobs and Skills” considers which technologies deserve the characterization of “revolutionary” due to their capacity to change entire organizations – and even societies — vs. those that only substitute narrowly for past technologies. We’ll examine past anxieties related to automation and evaluate the extent to which the “worst-case” scenarios about employment loss have or have not come to pass – and evaluate claims of “this time it’s different”. • Module 2: “Intelligent Technologies: How Will They Affect Work and Organizations?” explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) is changing core “managing people” activities (e.g., hiring and performance appraisal) – plus shifting the locus of management away from human bosses and into algorithms. We’ll examine controversies around “gig work”, i.e., the positives of worker schedule flexibility vs. the negatives of algorithmic control. We’ll also consider the metaverse and its potential for unleashing human creativity and fostering richer and more nuanced virtual communication - as well as providing organizations with new ways to monitor and control. • Module 3: “Technology and Policy” examines three policy issues. First, how can we inject more ethical criteria into the development of artificial intelligence and algorithms affecting work? Second, what are the pros and cons of “universal basic income”, whose premise is that technological change will soon lead to an unprecedented amount of job elimination? Third, how does “technology make us dumber”? How can we avoid the obsolescence of critical human skills? Take this course to be ready to manage the strategic and analytic issues involving the design and implementation of technology at work - and for a preview of your own future work life. Requirements include: class participation; in-class quizzes; interviewing someone you know to ask how technology has affected their work life; and the “In Hindsight” group assignment looking back on past scares about a particular technology’s impact on work - and what actually happened.","For questions about enrollment and permission requests, please email MGMT-Courseinfo@wharton.upenn.edu",Not available,"WH UG TIA: Technology, Innovations, Analytics (WUTI)

Teamwork and Interpersonal Influence,MGMT 3010,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"Organizations emerge because individuals cannot (or do not want to) accomplish their goals alone. Likewise, employees pursue projects in teams and other small units because there is strength in numbers. For example, over 80% of Fortune 1,000 companies use teams to accomplish their goals. As such, collaboration - in relationships and in teams - is the building block of organizational effectiveness. In addition, most of your work each day will occur in a social context, and it will require you to influence others, and be influenced by, others. In this course we will use the latest evidence from the science of organizations to understand key tactics that can help you work more effectively with others and better influence and lead them as you strive to attain shared goals. We will cover topics such as team coordination, team decision making, interpersonal influence, leader effectiveness, and ethics.

Growing Social Impact,MGMT 4010,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This course seeks to address a gap at the core of contemporary entrepreneurship: despite a growing desire to pursue prosocial goals and affect positive change in the world, most founders have little understanding of how to measure, manage, and scale their impact. This creates the risk that financial goals will play an outsized role in decision-making, particularly as the venture scales, leading founders to drift away from social impact aims - or to pursue goals that fail to deliver on their intended impacts. MGMT 401 fulfils the Wharton capstone requirement with a hands-on approach to addressing these issues. Students will work hand-in-hand with the founding teams of pre-selected startups from the Wharton venture community to develop a strategy for measuring social impact, and ensuring fidelity to social goals as the venture goes to market and begins to scale. Projects will be group-based, and will ask students to integrate learnings on social enterprise, impact measurement, and impact investing, with prior coursework on entrepreneurship, social impact, business ethics, leadership, team dynamics, and venture finance. Students will leave the class with a deeper appreciation of the potential for business to be a force for good in the world, and the difficulties that this can pose during the founding and growth stages of a new business. The class will be of value to students who are interested in creating socially impactful businesses, as well as to those who want to work in the ecosystem that supports such ventures (e.g., consulting, or impact investing).",Not available,Enrollment in this course is restricted.

Value Creation and Value Capture in American Business History,MGMT 7140,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course examines how the kind of firms in which most Wharton students will spend the next stage of their careers came to be as they are today. At a superficial level, the course's objectives are descriptive and narrative. But history, considered thoughtfully and critically, is never just description and a narrative and the course's deeper purpose is to give students some idea of how to think about the future evolution of firms and industries. In this the course is as much an applied strategy course as it is a historical survey. The course considers the development of the business enterprise as an economic institution. It also covers the evolution of competition and strategy, marketing institutions, some aspects of the history of operations management, and corporate finance. Issues arising in these different management disciplines are considered in part for the purpose of showing off their interrelationships. Questions of how value can be created and captured at the enterprise level form the core of the perspective. The course's focus is on American developments, since many of the innovations took place here, but there is scope for comparison with Japan and the leading European economies if there is student interest. Chronologically the course runs from Franklin's days through the early twenty-first century. The individual classes proceed through discussion of actual business decisions and performance in a series of challenging and otherwise interesting moments in the evolution of the American business environment. The materials are unusual for the Wharton School--they are not just often case-like but wherever possible draw on documents contemporary to the decisions such as correspondence, internal memoranda, minutes of meetings, old newspaper and magazine stories, and eyewitness accounts. The objective in this is to give students as minimally mediated access as is feasible to what the embedded actors knew and thought. The materials require thoughtful preparation. Weekly short writing assignments during the first twelve weeks of the term develop students' skill in turning such preparation into crisp analytical prose. (This will be valuable to most ex-students in the early phases of their post-Wharton careers.) The course as a process is much more focused on the students than many and the most productive experience of it demands that the students both engage with the materials when they prepare and then take an active role in the class discussion. The largest single element in the grading is a substantial term paper on a topic agreeable to both the student and the instructor.

Reforming Mass Incarceration and the Role of Business,MGMT 7860,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This half-semester course introduces current and future leaders to mass incarceration in the U.S., and its effect on employment and entrepreneurship prospects for formerly incarcerated people. We will explore both the challenges of our correctional system as well as potential solutions. For example, over 600,000 people return home from U.S. prisons each year. For most, the return is short-lived as two-thirds are re-incarcerated within three years of release. We will consider many of the reasons why this occurs, including research indicating that the lack of employment opportunities is a major contributor. We will also hear from those directly impacted by the justice system. By the end of the course, you will be among the more educated leaders not just on mass incarceration, but on how to think about ways that the business community can contribute to the success of those impacted by the criminal justice system.

People Analytics,MGMT 7930,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This course examines the use of data to improve how people are managed within organizations. Recent years have seen a growing movement to bring more science to how we manage people. In some cases, that means ensuring that whatever practices and approaches we adopt are backed up by solid evidence as to their effectiveness. Often, organizations will seek to go further, analyzing their own data to identify problems and learn what is working and what is not in their own context. This course applies the insights of the people analytics movement to help students become better managers and more critical analysts within their organizations. The course aims to develop students in three specific ways. First, it provides students with an up-to-the-minute grounding in current evidence about managing people, providing a knowledge base that can ensure that their future management is guided by best practices. Second, it develops the skills and understanding necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of evidence on people management, allowing them to make the most of the analysis available to them as they make people decisions. Third, it provides guidance and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather data of their own, and making them more skilled analysts.

Social Entrepreneurship,MGMT 8120,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This is a course on creating a business to attack a social problem and thereby accomplish both social impact and financial sustainability. For this course, social entrepreneurship is defined as entrepreneurship used to profitably confront social problems. This definition therefore views social entrepreneurship as a distinct alternative to public sector initiatives. The basic thesis is that many social problems, if looked at through an entrepreneurial lens, create opportunity for someone to launch a venture that generates profits by alleviating that social problem. This sets in motion a virtuous cycle - the entrepreneur is incented to generate more profits and in so doing, the more the profits made, the more the problem is alleviated. Even if it is not possible to eventually create a profit-making enterprise, the process of striving to do so can lead to a resource-lean not-for-profit entity. Creating a profitable social entrepreneurship venture is by no means a simple challenge. Cross-listed with MGMT 212.",Attendance at first day is mandatory.

While neuroscience made tremendous strides throughout the past few decades, rarely were meaningful applications developed outside of medicine.

Currently, applications to marketing research and product development are experiencing explosive growth that has been met with both excitement and skepticism.

A central theme of the course is that the answer to these strategic problems varies over time depending on the stage of the product life cycle at which marketing decisions are being made. As such, the PLC serves as the central organizing vehicle of the course. We will explore such issues as how to design optimal strategies for the launch of new products and services that arise during the introductory phase, how to maximize the acceleration of revenue during the growth phase, how to sustain and extend profitability during the mature phase, and how to manage a business during the inevitable decline phase.","Wharton MBA course.

Consumer Neuroscience,MKTG 7380,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"How can studying the brain improve our understanding of consumer behavior? While neuroscience made tremendous strides throughout the past few decades, rarely were meaningful applications developed outside of medicine. Recently, however, breakthroughs in measurement and computation have accelerated brain science, and created an array of opportunities in business and technology. Currently, applications to marketing research and product development are experiencing explosive growth that has been met with both excitement and skepticism. This mini course provides an overview of the neuroscience behind and the potential for these developments. Topics will range from well-known and widely used applications, from eye-tracking measures in the lab and the field, to emerging methods and measures such as mobile technologies, face-reading, and neural predictors of market response. This course is self-contained and has no prerequisites. However, students with some background in business, economics, psychology, and/or neuroscience are likely to find some of the material covered in this course complementary to their existing knowledge. Much of the foundational work in consumer neuroscience and neuroeconomics involves laboratory experiments. Accordingly, we will read and discuss several experimental papers and the craft of designing an experiment will occasionally be discussed. However, we will not dedicate significant time to the methodology of experimental design and analysis. As will become clear as the course progresses, “consumer neuroscience"" can be used to study almost any aspect of consumer behavior.",Varies by section,"Enrollment limited to students in the Wharton Graduate division.

"Considering Race, Class and Punishment in the American Prison System",MLA 5017,Seminar,In Class,1,"This writing seminar will sharpen and expand our writing, while bringing to our hearts and minds a deeper understanding of the reality of imprisonment in the United States. This system never goes away. This year it is locking up more than 2,300,000 men, women and children—the highest per-capita rate of imprisonment in the world. Even when we know the statistics and watch shows about crime and jail on TV, what do we really know about life behind bars? For a year? Ten years? Life? As a young journalist, I saw how the criminal justice system was used to suppress Black leadership. I felt drawn to teach creative writing at Holmesburg Prison, to eventually investigate the state prison system, interview prisoners, make friendships, write a newspaper series, magazine articles, and my first book on the subject. For nearly five decades, I’ve observed the human cost of a prison system that connects and damages all of our lives and keeps people from poverty in place. In this course, we will seek insights in books and stories written from prisoners’ personal experiences. We’ll also read scholars—Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Angela Davis and others—who shed light on the historical repetitions and political exploitations. Guest speakers will include public defenders, parolees, former prisoners, and those fighting for prisoners’ rights and re-entry. Students will gain a more intimate understanding of how the legacies of slavery, racism, the prejudices of class, caste, and misogyny intersect and determine who goes to prison and who does not. Students will free-write for ten minutes a day, every day, and write personal reflections on readings, films, and guest speakers. Responses will lead to essays or stories that students write and present for class discussion. These key pieces may draw from observation, facts and imagination, and may traverse literary nonfiction, memoir, fiction, or poetry.

MLA Seminar: Prison Narratives,MLA 5020,Seminar,In Class,1,Reading and discussion course on selected topics in the liberal arts.,"Prisons, camps, and gulags are total institutions which strip prisoners of basic human rights, choices, services, social contacts and freedom from terror and humiliation. The prisoner is labeled as morally and socially inferior and is removed from society. He/she is then subjected to the prison organization, hierarchy, and the prisoners’ sub-culture. Under such circumstances, prisoners are often driven, either by the conditions, their own beliefs, and talents or with the help of outside mentors to craft writing or other artistic forms about their life in prison. Such writings may lead to changes in the prisoner’s identity and life perspective. In this course we shall examine both narratives of criminal convicts and of political prisoners in America, and other countries.Texts will include the prison letters of Nelson Mandela, resistance narratives by men and women, jail poem by Oscar Wild, a prisoners’ journal, autobiographical novels and memoirs of Jean Genet and Alexander Solzhenitsyn and a selection from a TV series about women prison. Writing assignments will be short responses to the readings and a final paper.","Enrollment limited to students with a semester level of Graduate, Masters Candidate, Graduate, Post-Baccalaureate or Professional.",Not available,W 5:15pm-8:14pm (8/27 to 12/9),Batsheva Ben-Amos,3.9,3.9,2.6,2.5,,,,[1.0]

"Policy: Analysis of Issues, Strategy and Process",MSSP 6280,Lecture,In Class,1,"Policy analysis requires an understanding of social problems/social issues and the processes by which policy is developed and implemented. Critical skills in many policy frameworks include: problem definition and analysis, review of relevant research, identification of possible actions, implementation and evaluation, and fiscal analysis. Competency in written and oral communication is also essential. To develop these and related skills, this course utilizes as a base a dynamic social problem analysis framework that addresses issues of equity, equality and adequacy. It also examines multiple theoretical and analytical perspectives. Through the review of contemporary and historical social policy debates and provisions, selected case examples and policy briefs, this course provides students with an understanding of the policy roles of the legislative and executive branches of government, including goal setting, policy rulemaking and enactment, allocation of resources, financing, regulation, and implementation. The policy process at state and local levels of government will also be addressed.

Economics for Social Policy,MSSP 6680,Lecture,In Class,1,"Economics allows us to determine the costs and benefits of social policies like cash benefits, unemployment insurance, health insurance, pensions, education, etc. Policies typically affect the behavior of agents like individuals, families and firms, and we have to take these reactions into account when analyzing policy. Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government. Policy makers have to take these phenomena into account in order to design a good income support system.",Varies by section,"Undergraduate level students may not enroll.

Democratizing Data? Critical Data Studies in Algorithmic Governance,MSSP 7100,Lecture,In Class,1,"With the advent of digital technologies and the increasing power of computational analytics, the proliferation and ubiquity of data production has increased at exponential rates enabling new possibilities for social analysis. This course will examine the emergence of democratizing data – the movement to make government and other data more widely or publicly available and its potential enabling for democratic possibilities. The types of data being made available, through various analytic systems, and the ways in which their accessibility and inaccessibility is contributing to reconfigured power relations, will be described. The paradigmatic tensions and shifts that have emerged in the debates on “Big Data,” such as deductive versus inductive reasoning and the challenges posed to statistical sampling theory, will be interrogated. The appropriation of machine learning and predictive analytic algorithms for social analysis will be critically explored. Issues related to the ethical and legal use of administrative data, particularly data related to patient, client, student, and taxpayer information will be considered, as well as from internet-based sources including social media. Potential solutions to data security challenges will be additionally considered. Methods for web-scraping of data, analysis of web traffic data, and the use of social networking data in the modeling of social phenomena and public opinion will be examined. Students will learn how to make results accessible to non-technical audiences via data visualization tools, such as web-based data dashboards and web-based maps. These topics will be discussed for the analysis of health, education, and social policy as well as their implications for questions pertaining to race, gender, class, sexuality, dis/abilities, age, and youth culture.

Reproductive Justice Policy,MSSP 7801,Seminar,In Class,1,"Social Policy Topics: Reproductive Justice Policy - With the impactful decision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the US Supreme Court in 2022 struck down almost 50 years of federal policy precedent of Roe v. Wade (1973). This opened a time of confusion as states scrambled to determine the meaning and implications of existing and future state and local policies. This course specifically utilizes the term reproductive justice. As Ross & Solinger (2017) describe, the definition of reproductive justice intentionally moves beyond the pro-choice/pro-life perspectives of policies regulating abortion and focuses policy assessment through core principles of 1) the right not to have a child, 2) the right to have a child, 3) the right to parent children in a safe and healthy environment, and 4) sexual autonomy and gender freedom for every human being. This course will first provide historical context of reproductive justice policy in USA history, then focus on local, state, and federal policies regulating reproductive justice. Policies will be particularly analyzed through the lenses of LGBTQ+, race, disability, and critical theory.","Enrollment is limited to students with a major in Social Policy and Social Policy & Data Analytics.

Family Economic Mobility: Problems and Policies,MSSP 7960,Seminar,In Class,1,"The experiences and voices of mothers, fathers, children, employers, children's teachers, human service workers, job training providers, policymakers and others in cities across America graphically show us the ""real life"" challenges to economic mobility facing today's families and organizations. These voices particularly illustrate how economic, social, and cultural policies, practices, and beliefs intersect to perpetuate economic inequality for low-income and many middle-income working families alike. The labor market, welfare and workforce programs, public schools and government are some of the institutions implicated in this intersection. In the course we deconstruct concepts such as the ""work ethic,"" ""family-friendly workplace,"" and ""good jobs"" in terms of economic, racial and cultural inequalities and, more broadly, in terms of their meaning, aims and rhetoric.

The course is intended for students with a basic knowledge of regression, and will be especially useful for students with practical experience in a policy setting who want to learn about advanced research methods. The course begins by exploring policy analysis frameworks, and the contexts of social policy and social policy research. The remainder of the course explores a variety of common approaches to the conduct of social policy research by looking at the types of questions social policy analysts most frequently ask, and the types of answers that they are most often able to provide. The policy analysis approaches we will examine include: needs assessment methodologies (e.g. the “epidemiology” of social problems); analyses of client-level service utilization patterns (e.g. creating “typologies”); modeling trends in demand for services over time (e.g. forecasting); locational and other spatial factors associated with need, service use, and resource allocation decisions (e.g. block grant formula funding); machine learning (e.g. predictive analytics); the roles of qualitative research methods in policy research; comparative research on social welfare policy; performance management applications of administrative data; and longitudinal, multisectoral research using integrated administrative data systems. The application of these various methods is illustrated with studies of mental health, homelessness, criminal justice, child welfare, housing and segregation, welfare reform, income inequality and social service planning.

"On Belonging: Music, Displacement, and Well-Being (SNF Paideia Program Course)",MUSC 0181,Seminar,In Class,1,"The 2020s has begun as a time of global existential angst: we are all living with so much uncertainty and change. Think of the impact of the COVID pandemic and the questioning of science in the form of vaccine resistance; climate change challenges; a technological and educational revolution; growing income inequality; the urgency of BLM protests in the USA, moves against dictatorships, the need to decolonize universities, and the pressure to address human rights and refugee challenges. But it is also a moment of real excitement, with increased technological access and presence in our lives. In fact, the capacity to connect to others almost anywhere in the world, immediately, is truly revolutionary. As is the capacity to plug into the sound of the world’s music in an instant. Through personal music listening, for example, we can use music to soothe, to excite, to travel imaginatively, to focus, for meditation, as a soundtrack to our everyday lives, and as emotional regulation. But the work of music for personal wellbeing and collective healing is much larger than just an individualized listening experience. This seminar opens up the issue of emotional regulation and collective healing by examining the relationship between sound and musical practice, performance, and engagement, both locally and around the world. You might think about this seminar as a kind of reflexive moment as you arrive on campus: as undergraduates and members of communities you will think about the relationship between your own recent move/displacement and the work of music/sound as a strategy of individual and collective belonging. There will be an ABCS component to the class.",Not available,Enrollment limited to students with the Penn Classification Freshman attribute.,"Academically Based Community Service Courses (UNAS)

1000 Years of Musical Listening,MUSC 1300,Lecture,In Class,1,"We know that we like music and that it moves us, yet it is often difficult to pinpoint exactly why, and harder still to explain what it is we are hearing. This course takes on those issues. It aims to introduce you to a variety of music, and a range of ways of thinking, talking and writing about music. The majority of music dealt with will be drawn from the so-called ""Classical"" repertory, from the medieval period to the present day, including some of the 'greats' such as Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Berlioz, and Verdi, but will also introduce you to music you will most likely never have encountered before. This course will explore the technical workings of music and the vocabularies for analyzing music and articulating a response to it; it also examines music as a cultural phenomenon, considering what music has meant for different people, from different societies across the ages and across geographical boundaries. As well as learning to listen ourselves, we will also engage with a history of listening. No prior musical knowledge is required. (Formerly Music 021).

Thinking About Popular Music,MUSC 1420,Lecture,In Class,1,"Catchy yet controversial. Fun but hard-hitting. Popular music is not just entertaining: it presents societal issues, raises questions, expresses ideas. This course considers how popular music of the 20th century manifested the hopes, contradictions, ingenuity, and challenges of life in the United States, as seen and heard through the experiences of musicians and audiences. We will address three core questions: (1) How is “talent” and “good” music distinguished? (2) What happens when we treat music as “property,” especially with respect to broader ideas of ownership and credit? (3) When, how, and why is music considered dangerous? We delve into these questions by profiling musicians’ lives, analyzing the musical traits of specific repertoire, investigating changes in how music circulates, and situating popular music in U.S. cultural history. This course is not a chronological survey and does not aim to cover all U.S. popular music (or global popular music). Instead, each core question is addressed through case studies. Over the course of the semester students learn listening and analytic skills, how to engage critically with a range of writings about music, how to develop compelling arguments and articulate them verbally in class discussions and in writing assignments.","During the add/drop/swap period registration seats will be available on a first come first serve basis.

World Musics and Cultures,MUSC 1500,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course examines how we as consumers in the ""Western"" world engage with musical difference largely through the products of the global entertainment industry. We examine music cultures in contact in a variety of ways-- particularly as traditions in transformation. Students gain an understanding of traditional music as live, meaningful person-to-person music making, by examining the music in its original site of production, and then considering its transformation once it is removed, and recontextualized in a variety of ways. The purpose of the course is to enable students to become informed and critical consumers of ""World Music"" by telling a series of stories about particular recordings made with, or using the music of, peoples culturally and geographically distant from the US. Students come to understand that not all music downloads containing music from unfamiliar places are the same, and that particular recordings may be embedded in intriguing and controversial narratives of production and consumption. At the very least, students should emerge from the class with a clear understanding that the production, distribution, and consumption of world music is rarely a neutral process.

We will discuss not only the historical documents that survive about these two masterworks (scores, librettos, letters etc.) but also today’s productions available in video. Why was the myth of Orpheus central to creators and audiences? What do these two operas and their performances tell us about being human in the world, both back then and today? How do we approach and understand this 400-years old multimedia genre, and why do these works still attract worldwide audiences today? We will also investigate works by Sartorio, Lully, Charpentier, Purcell, Telemann, and Handel.

"Institutions, Intelligentsia, and Ideology in Black Music Historiography",MUSC 7400,Seminar,In Class,1,Seminar on selected topics in African American Music. See department website (under course tab) for current term course description: https://music.sas.upenn.edu,"In 1971, musicologist Eileen Southern published The Music of Black Americans which became a definitive work in the field of Black music studies. Southern’s work was groundbreaking as before the 1970s, several books and articles had been written on multiple forms of Black music including spirituals, blues, ragtime, jazz, concert music but relatively few of those works had been written by Black scholars or critics. Furthermore, many of these early writings did not accurately, objectively, or adequately describe the musical practices and values of African Americans. However, intense public and scholarly interest in Black culture after the Civil Rights Movement led to the scrutinization of earlier studies that failed to address the intricacies involved in understanding Black music aesthetics, traditions, cultures, and people. Accordingly, during the late-1960s and early-1970s, there was a flourishing in Black music research that embraced the study of Black life and culture in its totality leading to the formulation of new methodologies and theoretical models. Overall, the work from this period laid out important structures and themes for future research regarding African American music. In this course, inspired by the recent recovery work of musicologist Tammy Kernodle, we will trace the rise of a Black music intelligentsia and formation of a Black music scholarship infrastructure, particularly focusing on the transformative period of the late-twentieth century. Through the analysis of foundational scholarship that has contributed to the intellectual and ideological evolution of the field, we will explore the paradigm-shifting interventions made by music scholars such as Eileen Southern, Samuel A. Floyd, Jr., Portia Maultsby and many others. A particular emphasis will be placed on the establishment of Black music centers and academic journals, such as the Black Music Research Journal and The Black Perspective in Music, which have profoundly influenced the framework of Black music scholarship. By exploring the establishment of Black music institutions and notable academic journals, we will gain insights into the systemic challenges and successes encountered in institutionalizing the study of Black music. Overall, the goal of this course is to deepen our understanding of the intellectual history of Black music studies and better understand how the work of the Black music intelligentsia not only infused the field with authenticity, care, joy, and rigor but also validated these qualities as legitimate scholarly expressions.",Enrollment is limited to Graduate/Research level students.,"MUSC Music Tier Three Course (AMTH)

This course does not cover statistics in a traditional way, in the sense that it does not provide a comprehensive survey of statistical tests, nor does it dive very deeply into formal mathematical derivations of those tests (information about such things can be found in textbooks and all over the web). Instead, the course focused on teaching students how to apply quantitative approaches to now they think about neuroscience research from beginning to end, including defining clear hypotheses; designing experiments to test those hypotheses; collecting, visualizing, analyzing, and interpreting data in reference to those hypotheses; and keeping effective and transparent records at each stage to ensure rigor and reproducibility. There are two main components to the course. The first component consists of a series of four modules, each of which is designed to use a specific example from neuroscience to illustrate a set of quantitative approaches and tools. The second component consists of group projects that focus on designing and implementing quantitative analyses for existing data sets (e.g., from rotation projects).",Not available,Enrollment is limited to students with a major in Medicine or Neuroscience.,Not available,MWF 8:30am-9:59am (8/26 to 12/19),Joshua Gold,,,,,,,,[1.0]

"Building Inclusive, Poverty-Informed Communities",NPLD 5980,Seminar,In Class,1,"Poverty is fundamentally about scarcity—a lack of life’s basic human needs, which is not limited to what we may think such as food, water, and shelter. We often reduce poverty to simplistic terms; however, its profound impact affects people’s overall well-being and opportunities. This leaves impacted individuals, families, and communities experiencing a persistent threat to safety and security, a lack of belonging, and learned helplessness. This course addresses both the immediate needs of individuals experiencing poverty and alternatives to creating sustainable, systemic changes to promote equity, inclusion, and belonging. This community-engaged/service-learning course examines Philadelphia place-based poverty, with variations in intensity and manifestation. Students will embrace a participatory and culturally humble approach to understanding root causes of poverty through a combination of lectures, immersive classroom experiences, site visits to local nonprofits, and service-learning placement assignments. Students will gain a deep understanding of the complex and multifaceted realities of poverty, including the laws and policies that contribute to and perpetuate widespread poverty in the US. This course examines the issue of poverty within the context of domestic affairs while also considering international human rights standards. This transformative and impactful service-learning course is designed for students who are passionate about inclusivity and reducing barriers. It aims to explore how nonprofits empower economically vulnerable individuals, families, and communities to achieve an improved quality of life. The Netter Center for Community Partnerships has designated this course as an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course because it integrates practical engagement with the community alongside traditional teaching methods.","ABCS Course.

From providing the scaffolding for the unique architecture of neurons, to guiding intracellular trafficking, to supporting neuronal migration and connectivity, microtubules are important for a variety of neuronal roles. Consequentially, the dysfunction of microtubules and microtubule-associated-proteins is associated with a number of nervous system disorders. This seminar will explore the role of microtubules in a number of neurobiological diseases and disorders including Neurodevelopmental disorders (ex. Fragile X, Lissencephaly), Neurodegenerative Disorders (ex. Alzheimer's and the Tauopathies, Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia), Psychiatric Disorders (Ex.

"The Neuroscience behind the addiction to chocolate, wine, coffee and tobacco",NRSC 4440,Seminar,In Class,1,"Both clinical observations and popular culture support the idea that food might have addictive properties. Similar to the narrative for addictive drugs,individuals and the media use terms like ""food addict"" and ""chocoholic"", and refer to cravings, symptoms of withdrawal, and escalating patterns of eating that might be viewed as evidence of tolerance. The class will discuss chocolate and coffee as examples of so-called ""addictive"" food and compare their effects and mechanisms with those of alcohol and nicotine, two substances with well-characterzed addictive properties. Furthermore, we will discuss why some forms of overeating are thought to reflect an addictive behavior. Considering the social dimension of alcohol,coffee, and tobacco consumption and the fact that large numbers of the population consume them together, we will also discuss the possible interactive effects of combinationsof these psychoactive substances on mood and disease state. At the end of the course the student will become familiar with the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence, the anatomy and physiology of the brain circuits involvedin reward processing and drug depencence, and the neurotransmitter systems involved.",Not available,"Enrollment limited to students with a semester level of Senior.

Music and the brain: the new and old science of music,NRSC 4450,Seminar,In Class,1,"In a world where humans can't seem to agree on much of anything, there is one thing that still unites us: we love music. Why should abstract sequences of sounds give us such strong emotional reactions? Why indeed should they give us any emotional reaction at all? On every continent, today and throughout history, there is not a single human culture that has ever been described that does not make music. Within cultures, music is so ubiquitous that we actually have clinical terms (amusia and musical anhedonia) to describe people who don't understand or don't enjoy music. And yet, despite this ubiquity, the evolutionary origin and purpose of music remains unknown. Not only do people everywhere make music - they do so in fundamentally similar ways. All over the world people divide rhythm into twos and threes; all over the world people divide the frequency spectrum logarithmically, in octaves; with a very few exceptions, we divide octaves into no more than 12 steps, and we use subsets of 5-7 of these tones at a time. Not only that, but many cultures seem to have independently arrived at the same sets of 5-7 notes. These are probably not coincidences. If not coincidence, then what? In this course we look for explanations to these and other questions about music by looking at something that humans all over the globe have in common: the brain. Using readings from the primary literature and classic texts, supplemented with software exercises and analysis, we will see how many of the age-old mysteries and questions of music can be either answered or in some cases amplified by a consideration of brain mechanisms. Thinking about music in the context of brain function also provides a biological and evolutionary rationale not just for why music is the way it is, but why it should exist at all. More broadly, this course is an example of what can (and cannot) be accomplished by addressing aesthetic and philosophical questions as scientific and empirical ones.

This course explores the answers to these questions and many more through the complementary lenses of design thinking and behavioral economics. Design thinking is a structured approach to innovation and problem solving that puts human needs at the center of solutioning. Behavioral economics, a field at the intersection of psychology and economics, helps us understand the fundamental psychological forces—including cognitive biases, mental shortcuts, and inconsistent time preferences—that might lead us to act against our best interest. With the theoretical insights of behavioral economics and the pragmatic, solutions-focused orientation of design thinking, we will develop and prototype desirable, feasible, and viable interventions to change health-related behaviors. Through lectures on behavioral economics theory, critical discussions of the empirical literature (including ethical and equity considerations), and hands-on practice applying human-centered design techniques to multiple design challenges, students will build relevant, practical expertise in behavioral design for public health and health care innovation.

Response to Chronic Illness: Theory and Research,NURS 8280,Seminar,In Class,1,"Millions of people of all ages live with chronic illness(es). A diagnosis of a chronic illness is a life-changing event, causing disruption and a sense of loss for many. Common early responses are stress, anxiety, depression, fear, and anger. Over time, with support and experience with the illness, many adjust. But, others report persistent feelings of loss due to physical, emotional, spiritual/existential, social, occupational, and/or financial influences of chronic illness. Those who adjust the best typically find a way to return a sense of normalcy to their lives. Loved ones and caregivers are equally affected by chronic illness and much has been written in recent years about caregiver burden. However, some individuals (caregivers and patients) report positive responses to illness, including a deepened purpose for living and a reordering of life priorities. The focus of this course is on individual responses to chronic illness- the person diagnosed and his/her loved ones. This course is intended to complement N818, which focuses on families and dyads dealing with chronic illness. In this course we will explore the major theoretical perspectives that underlie this field.

No prior technical background is assumed and hence every effort is made to build most of the lectures from the basics. However, the Fall semester class will assume basic understanding of statistics and will focus more on big data analytics. Some assignments in the fall will involve data analytics using Python or R.",Auditors need permission.,Not available,"ENG Engineering Entrepreneurship (EUNP)

Advanced Decision Systems: Evolutionary Computation,OIDD 3190,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course is taught with the more descriptive title of ""Agents, Games, and Evolution."" It explores applications and fundamentals of strategic behavior. Strategic, or game-theoretic, topics arise throughout the social sciences. The topics include--and we discuss--trust, cooperation, market-related phenomena (including price equilibria and distribution of wealth), norms, conventions, commitment, coalition formation, and negotiation. They also include such applied matters as design of logistics systems, auctions, and markets generally (for example, markets for electric power generation). In addressing these topics we focus on the practical problem of finding effective strategies for agents in strategic situations (or games). Our method of exploration will be experimental: we review and discuss experiments, principally computational experiments, on the behavior of boundedly rational agents in strategic (or game-theoretic) situations. Course work includes readings, discussions in class (organized as a seminar), examinations, and a course project on a topic chosen by the participants.",Not available,Not available,"PPE Choice and Behavior (APPC)

Thinking with Models: Business Analytics for Energy and Sustainability,OIDD 5250,Lecture,In Class,1,"Models are lenses. They are instruments with which we view, interpret, and give meaning to data. In this course, students will be exposed to and do work in all phases of the modeling life-cycle, including model design and specification, model construction (including data gathering and testing), extraction of information from models during post-solution analysis, and creation of studies that use modeling results to support conclusions for scientific or decision making purposes. In addition, the course will cover critical assessments of fielded models and studies using them. The course will focus broadly on models pertaining to energy and sustainability. This is not only an inherently interesting and important area, but it is very much a public one. In consequence, models, data, and studies using them are publicly and profusely available, as is excellent journalism, which facilitates introductions to specific topics. The course covers selected topics in energy and sustainability. Essential background will be presented as needed, but the course is not a comprehensive overview of energy and sustainability. Modeling in the area of energy and sustainability analytics is rife with uncertainty, and yet decisions must be made. Uncertainty, and how to deal with it in model-based decision making, is an overarching theme of the course. We will focus on energy and sustainability, but that area is hardly unique in being beset with deep and vexing uncertainties. The lessons we learn will generalize. The overall aim of the course is to teach facility with modeling and to use real-world data, models, and studies in doing so. In addition, students with interests in investment or policy analysis in the energy sphere will find the course's subject area focus useful.

Scaling Operations: Linking Strategy and Execution,OIDD 6360,Lecture,In Class,1,"The goal of this course is to make strategic scaling decisions that are grounded in operational reality. We study how to build and evaluate the operational business model of the firm to maximize value with the focus on scaling the firm's operations. We will approach the challenge of scaling by taking a holistic view that incorporates competitive strategy, financial evaluation, and the customer experience. We focus on decisions and challenges that many firms that try to scale their operations face with the focus on assessing the readiness of the firm to scale, and the required steps to scale. In particular, we will discuss whether the firm should build competencies in-house (i.e., investing in a portfolio of assets) or buy them (i.e., developing and implementing a global sourcing strategy and integrating external partners) and the risks associated with scaling these. We will also discuss the organizational implications of scaling. There are no formal pre-requisites to the class.

People Analytics,OIDD 7930,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This course examines the use of data to improve how people are managed within organizations. Recent years have seen a growing movement to bring more science to how we manage people. In some cases, that means ensuring that whatever practices and approaches we adopt are backed up by solid evidence as to their effectiveness. Often, organizations will seek to go further, analyzing their own data to identify problems and learn what is working and what is not in their own context. This course applies the insights of the people analytics movement to help students become better managers and more critical analysts within their organizations. The course aims to develop students in three specific ways. First, it provides students with an up-to-the-minute grounding in current evidence about managing people, providing a knowledge base that can ensure that their future management is guided by best practices. Second, it develops the skills and understanding necessary to be thoughtful, critical consumers of evidence on people management, allowing them to make the most of the analysis available to them as they make people decisions. Third, it provides guidance and practice in conducting people analytics, preparing students to gather data of their own, and making them more skilled analysts.

Introduction to Optimization,OIDD 9120,Lecture,In Class,0.5,"This course constitutes the second part of a two-part sequence and serves as a continuation of the summer math camp. Mathematical optimization provides a unifying framework for studying issues of rational decision-making, optimal design, effective resource allocation and economic efficiency. It is a central methodology of many business-related disciplines, including operations research, marketing, accounting, economics, game theory and finance. In many of the disciplines, a solid background in optimization theory is essential for doing research. This course provides a rigorous introduction to the fundamental theory of optimization. It examines optimization theory in two primary settings: static optimization and optimization over time (dynamic programming). Applications from problem areas in which optimization plays a key role are also introduced. The goal of the course is to provide students with a foundation sufficient to use basic optimization in their own research work and/or to pursue more specialized studies involving optimization theory. The course is designed for entering doctoral students. The prerequisites are calculus, linear algebra and some familiarity with real analysis, as covered in summer math camp.

We will also examine how his pupil, Plato, and subsequently Aristotle, developed elaborate philosophical systems that address the nature of reality, knowledge, and human happiness.

Next, we will look at the philosophical work that has been done on the nature and reality of race as ordinarily understood in the contemporary United States. We will discuss racial anti-realism, social constructionism about race, and biological racial realism from well-known philosophers of race like Anthony Appiah, Sally Haslanger, and Joshua Glasgow. The second part of the course will focus on the nature of racism and social or political questions related to race or racism.

"Conflict, Ideology, and Public Discourse",PHIL 5962,Seminar,In Class,1,"This MLA seminar will deepen our understanding of the role that political and cultural ideologies -- such as liberalism, conservatism, nationalism, totalitarianism, fundamentalism, etc. -- play in contemporary public discourse and the psychology of ideological thinking that makes political conflicts so difficult to resolve. Drawing on a series of case studies in contemporary political, social and cultural conflict such as recent political campaigns and nationalist movements around the globe, we will identify and examine the ideologies driving such conflicts, and from these we will draw out the common philosophical characteristics and psychological features of ideological thinking. We will begin by considering a series of case studies in contemporary political, social and cultural conflict, drawn from contemporary events such as the 2012 political campaigns, the 2011 debt ceiling debate in Congress, nationalist movements around the globe, etc. We will identify and examine the ideologies driving such conflicts, and from these we will draw out the common philosophical characteristics and psychological features of ideological thinking. Throughout, we will seek to understand the deep attraction of ideological commitments and why they tend to push public discourse and behavior to extremes and even violence. Finally, we will consider efforts to reduce or resolve ideological conflicts thorugh strategies of political compromise, dialogue, toleration, and democratic deliberation.","We live in a divided country and a divided world. Contemporary public discourse – in politics and international relations, in the media and online, and throughout our national and global cultures – gives expression to intense, sometimes violent, disagreements and conflicts that obstruct the solution of important public policy questions, frustrate organizational objectives, and profoundly challenge our leaders and institutions. This MLA seminar course will explore the role of political, economic, and social ideologies in these conflicts and why this makes them so difficult to resolve. We will consider a variety of contemporary conflicts and ideologies and attempt to draw out some of their common philosophical and psychological characteristics, as well as explore possible strategies for reducing or resolving such conflicts.

Molecular Toxicology: Chemical and Biological Mechanisms,PHRM 5900,Lecture,In Class,1,"Course Goals: Exposures to foreign compounds (drugs, carcinogens, and pollutants) can disrupt normal cellular processes leading to toxicity. This course will focus on the molecular mechanisms by which environmental exposures lead to end-organ injury and to diseases of environmental etiology (neurodegenerative and lung diseases, reproduction disruption and cardiovascular injury). Students will learn the difficulties in modeling response to low-dose chronic exposures, how these exposures are influenced by metabolism and disposition, and how reactive intermediates alter the function of biomolecules. Mechanisms responsible for cellular damage, aberrant repair, and end-organ injury will be discussed. Students will learn about modern predictive molecular toxicology to classify toxicants, predict individual susceptibility and response to environmental triggers, and how to develop and validate biomarkers for diseases of environmental etiology. Students are expected to write a term paper on risk assessment on an environmental exposure using available TOXNET information.

The specific content and course of study will be partially determined by the themes that emerge in class discussions and assignments. However, students can expect to engage with questions such as: What is the relationship between self and other? What does it mean to benefit someone's well-being?

Poverty in the History of Political Thought,PSCI 0010,Seminar,In Class,1,The primary goal of the first-year seminar program is to provide every first-year student with the opportunity for a direct personal encounter with a faculty member in a small class setting devoted to a significant intellectual endeavor. First-year seminars also fulfill College General Education Requirements.,"Although a central concern for many canonical figures of Western political thought–including Plato, Montesquieu, Mandeville, Locke, and Rousseau–the causes of poverty and purported characteristics of “the poor” are often sidelined in discussions of the Western political theoretical tradition. In this seminar, we read canonical and non-canonical works on poverty as a lens to understand state formation, popular discontent, democracy, class collaboration and conflict, and colonial expansion. These works will cover the ancient and medieval periods but focus on the modern era. Finally, we also approach poverty in the history of political thought through its twentieth-century reception and will consider how this tradition informs contemporary discourse about poverty and the poor. Texts will include but are not limited to: Plato, The Republic; Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws; Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Sophie de Grouchy, Letters on Sympathy; Engels, The Condition of the Working-Class of England; and Karl Polanyi, The Great Transformation.",Enrollment limited to students with the Penn Classification Freshman attribute.,"College FND Cultural Diversity in US (AUCD)

Modern Political Thought,PSCI 0601,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will provide an overview of major figures and themes of modern political thought. We will focus on themes and questions pertinent to political theory in the modern era, particularly focusing on the relationship of the individual to community, society, and state. Although the emergence of the individual as a central moral, political, and conceptual category arguably began in earlier eras, it is in the seventeenth century that it takes firm hold in defining the state, political institutions, moral thinking, and social relations. The centrality of ""the individual"" has created difficulties, even paradoxes, for community and social relations, and political theorists have struggled to reconicle those throughout the modern era. We will consider the political forms that emerged out of those struggles, as well as the changed and distinctly ""modern"" conceptualizations of political theory such as freedom, responsibilty, justice, rights and obligations, as central categories for organizing moral and political life.","Several seats in this course have been reserved for LPS Students.

The second part focuses on the micro-picture: the household-level dynamics of poverty and development, including access to food and credit, the role of health and education, the transition from village to city life, and day-to-day governance. The third part of the course introduces students to the practicalities of designing and evaluating the efficacy of governance and poverty relief interventions and policies.

Changing American Electorate,PSCI 1202,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"In 1960, a Democratic candidate won a very narrow Presidential victory with just 100,000 votes; in 2000, the Democratic candidate lost but received 500,000 more votes than his opponent. Still, contemporary scholars and journalists have made a variety of arguments about just how much the American political landscape changed in the intervening 40 years, often calling recent decades a transformation. This course explores and critically evaluates those arguments. Key questions include: how, if at all, have Americans political attitudes and ideologies changed? How have their connections to politics changed? What has this meant for the fortunes and strategies of the two parties? How have the parties' base voters and swing voters changed? What changes in American society have advantaged some political messages and parties at the expense of others? Focusing primarily on mass-level politics, we consider a wide range of potential causes, including the role of race in American politics, suburbanization, economic transformations, the evolving constellation and structure of interest groups, declining social capital, the changing role of religion, immigration, and the actions of parties and political elites.

The Mechanics of American Foreign Policy (PIW),PSCI 2211,Seminar,In Class,1,"The Trump Presidency has profoundly shifted America's role in the world and the way in which key institutions of foreign policy making are staffed and positioned to advance America's interests. The ascent of extreme nationalists and nationalism in other power centers in the world along with growing distrust in government and public institutions may have marked the close of the two-decade post 9/11 era. Indeed, the global COVID-19 pandemic and the ways in which actors across the international spectrum have responded (or failed to respond) has led many to question the assumptions inherent in the post-9/11 international order and has marked the beginning of a new era of competition, a return to great-power politics, and the diminishing power of traditional actors, systems, and ideals on the global stage. This course will provide students with an in-depth, practical analysis of foreign policy and foreign policy making, with a view from Washington. It will also provide a baseline global literacy, through the lens of emerging ideas, institutions, interests, and actors, and focus on a framework for understanding shifts already underway in how Washington views the world. We will utilize less traditional resources, and instead focus on practical and ""real-world"" course material as well as less traditional instruction methods - utilizing and analyzing the sources and resources that policy makers in Washington rely upon. These include long-form journalism, official government documents, hearings and Congressional debate, think tank products, and news sources. Students will have the opportunity to engage with a variety of guest-speakers, all of whom have held senior official and non-governmental roles in American foreign policy making and influencing. Guest speakers will provide unique insight into their own experiences at the highest levels of foreign policy making and advocacy, and offer guidance as to how to pursue careers in foreign policy, national security, and international development.

In attempting to answer this question, we will pay special attention to (1) the various different types and sources of political disagreement and (2) the role of deliberation and reason-giving in a democracy. Through reading and debating works of contemporary political theory and philosophy, this course should help you to reflect on some fundamental but easily neglected questions about your own civic attitudes and behavior. What beliefs underpin your political commitments, why do you hold those beliefs, and why do other people see things differently? What makes you so sure that you’re right and they’re wrong? How, if at all, should you try to change their minds? When, if ever, should you refrain from supporting legal prohibition of actions that you feel sure are morally wrong? The course will be taught in a hybrid lecture/discussion format.

More than one course make be taken in a given semester.,"Free Speech and its First Amendment protections have rarely been as controversial and central to public discussion in the United States as they are today. After a brief introduction to free speech as understood before it became enshrined in the Constitution’s First Amendment, we’ll examine and trace its history in the U.S.—legally, politically, philosophically and socially—from 1791 to the present day. Topics explored will include such longstanding issues as dissent and censorship, flag burning, prior restraint, “fighting words,” and obscenity. More recent controversial matters include hate speech, free-speech zones, trigger warnings, offensiveness, “snowflakes,” online trolling, free speech on campus, regulation of social-media platforms, and whether free speech, traditionally a value fought for by the Left, is now more commonly embraced by the Right.

How do they affect international trade and development? When and how are international borders “securitized,” and how does this affect the flow of goods, people, and illicit activities around and across the border? How do states cooperate across international borders? While this course is designed primarily as a seminar in international relations, we will examine the meaning and function of boundary-making between states from multiple perspectives. Borders, border regions and border crossings have multiple significance as designations of state authority, security buffers, expressions of social meaning and opportunities for economic integration.

Comparative Political Analysis,PSCI 6100,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar is aimed primarily at graduate students planning to take doctoral exams in comparative politics. It provides a critical survey of the field of comparative politics, tracing the intellectual history of the field, examining shifts in conceptual frameworks and research traditions, and comparing alternative methodological approaches. The first half of the course generally examines how processes of political, economic, and social change have been theorized in the social sciences from the mid-19th century to the present. In this process, particular attention is paid to the bifurcation between theories that emphasize the ""universal"" (e.g. the homogenizing effects of specific processes or variables) and the ""particular"" (e.g. the persistence of distinctive historical legacies and trajectories). Since this bifurcation is reinforced by distinct styles and methods of research, the seminar also probes the recent battles between rational-choice, cultural, and structuralist scholars, while considering the trade-offs between varieties of formal, quantitative, and qualitative methods. In the second half, the focus shifts to the range of substantive problems investigated by scholars in the field of comparative politics. These topics cover the complex relations among nations, states and societies; the origins, consolidation, and patterns of democratic governance; political economy in relation to development processes and social policies; the intersection of international/global economy and domestic politics; the dynamics of revolutions and social movements; and alternative problematiques constructed from the point of view of real actors such as workers, women, and local communities. In all cases, As a whole, the course is designed to provide an introduction to important issues and debates that comparativists have regularly engaged in; to help you understand the assumptions behind, and differences between, particular approaches, methods, and styles of research; to examine whether current debates are spurring new or better research in a given field in light of past approaches; and to gauge whether there has been progress, fragmentation, or stagnation in the field of comparative politics as a whole.",Not available,Not available,"PSCI PhD Comparative Politics (HDPC)

First, the course is an opportunity for psychology and cognitive science undergrad majors to develop their professional and science communication skills and share their enthusiasm for these topics with high school students at a nearby public high school in West Philadelphia. In this regard, Penn students will prepare demonstrations and hands-on activities to engage local high school students, increase their knowledge in functions of the mind and brain, providing insights that may promote well being for the high school students and their community. This will be accomplished as students design and execute hands-on/minds-on activities on a range of psychology topics. There will be 10 sessions across the semester for these lessons, allowing the college and high school students to develop a consistent teacher-learner relationship. Second, students will explore the literature that discusses the need for better bridges between scientific research and the broader community. Discussions will incorporate the students' experiences, including challenges and rewards, as they bring psychology lessons to local youth. This academic portion of the course will include guest lectures from the Penn community who actively engaged in community partnerships.

A Neuroscience Perspective of Artificial Intelligence,PSYC 5490,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar course asks what would be required to achieve Strong Artificial Intelligence, also referred to as Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), in light of what we know about the emergence of life and mind in the universe. Specifically, we will consider the question whether it is possible for machines to become self-aware by asking what Natural Intelligence is, and considering what it implies about whether and how AGI can be achieved. To grapple with this question, in Part I of the course we will examine what is known about the emergence of Natural Intelligence in the universe. This study includes the phenomena of: (1a) Abiogenesis, (1b) The Universal Role of Entropy and Information in Evolution, (1c) Signal Transduction, intracellular signaling, and Mechanism of Stimulus-Response Coupling in Unicellular Organisms; (2a) The Evolution of the Metazoa during the Cambrian Explosion, (2b) The Consequences of Motility and Preditor - Prey Dynamics in the Metazoa for the Evolution of Complex Nervous Systems and Behaviors; (3a) The Implications of Invertebrate Navigation by Dead Reckoning for Understanding Insect Behavior, (3b) Insect Behavior in Relation to Robotics; (4a) Origin of the Vertebrates and the Evolution of the Vertebrate Nervous System, (4b) The Mammalian Neocortex; (5) Molecular Mechanisms of Synaptic Plasticity; (6) The Evolution of the Hominins and the Hominin Brain; (7) Higher-Order Thinking and Epistemology; (8a) Meta-awareness as the Foundation of Human Consciousness, (8b) The Fluidity of Mind Embodiment, (8c) Theories and Philosophy of Human Consciousness. (9a) Other Minds: The Atypical Nervous System of the Ctenophore and The Nervous System and Mind of the Octopus, (9b) Animal intelligence. (10a) The History and Trajectory of AI, (10b) Superintelligence, Human Cognitive Fluidity and the Existence of a Global Network of Human Superintelligence.","This seminar course examines the emergence of life and mind in the universe to understand Natural Intelligence as the essential antecedent of Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to provide a neuroscience perspective of AI and specifically to critically examine the question concerning whether machines can ever become self-aware. This seminar course addresses the big questions related to the emergence of life, and mind in the context of physical law. This includes consideration of the physical predicates of life and mind with emphasis on the central role of entropy and information in abiogenesis, the formation of life from non-living matter. Mechanisms of signal transduction, intracellular signaling, and stimulus-response coupling in unicellular organisms will show how these processes provide a highly conserved basis for the cognitive behavioral innovations of multicellular organisms. The origin of the vertebrates and the evolution of the vertebrate nervous system leading to the mammalian neocortex will be discussed in detail as the prelude to the evolution of the Hominins and the Hominin brain. Cortical innovations that led to higher-order thinking, and meta-awareness as the foundation of modern human consciousness will then be explored. Theories of human consciousness and the creativity that derives from the power of abstract thinking will be examined as the foundation of human collective intelligence that has led to the existence of a global network of human superintelligence. With this background, the history and nature of AI with special attention to neural networks will be considered in detail as we reflect on the irony that we neither know how the brain makes the mind nor how neural networks accomplish their impressive achievements.","Enrollment limited to students with a semester level of Graduate, Masters Candidate, Graduate, Post-Baccalaureate or Professional.",Not available,R 5:15pm-8:14pm (8/27 to 12/9),Richard Di Rocco,2.7,3.5,2.0,1.9,,,,[1.0]

How might vending machine design reduce soda consumption? How might we reduce alert fatigue in bedside nursing? How might tapping into social norms boost rates of mammography screening or reduce overprescribing of antibiotics? This course explores the answers to these questions and many more through the complementary lenses of design thinking and behavioral economics. Design thinking is a structured approach to innovation and problem solving that puts human needs at the center of solutioning. Behavioral economics, a field at the intersection of psychology and economics, helps us understand the fundamental psychological forces—including cognitive biases, mental shortcuts, and inconsistent time preferences—that might lead us to act against our best interest. With the theoretical insights of behavioral economics and the pragmatic, solutions-focused orientation of design thinking, we will develop and prototype desirable, feasible, and viable interventions to change health-related behaviors. Through lectures on behavioral economics theory, critical discussions of the empirical literature (including ethical and equity considerations), and hands-on practice applying human-centered design techniques to multiple design challenges, students will build relevant, practical expertise in behavioral design for public health and health care innovation.

"Portraits of Old Rus: Myth, Icon, Chronicle",REES 0100,Seminar,In Class,1,"Three modern-day nation-states – Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus – share and dispute the cultural heritage of Old Rus, and their political relationships revolve around interpretations of the past. Has the medieval Rus state been established by the Vikings or by the local Slavs? Is early Rus a mother state of Russia or of Ukraine, and, therefore, should it be spelled ‘Kyivan Rus,’ or ‘Kievan Rus’ in English? Has the culture of Russian political despotism been inherited from the Mongols, or is it an autochthonous ideology? The constructed past has a continuing importance in modern Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, and it is keenly referenced, often manipulatively, in contemporary social and political discourse. For example, President Putin invaded Ukraine under a pretense that its territory has “always” been an integral part of Russia and its history. The course covers eight centuries of cultural, political, and social history of the lands that are now within the borders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, from early historical records through the 18th century, a period that laid the foundation for the Russian Empire and the formation of modern nations. Students gain knowledge about formative events and prominent figures, as well as social and cultural developments during this period. The course takes multidisciplinary approach by combining the study of textual sources, objects of art and architecture, music, ritual, and film in their social and historical contexts. Students learn to analyze and interpret primary sources (historical documents and literary texts), identify their intellectual issues, and understand the historical, cultural, and social contexts in which these sources emerged. While working with these primary sources students learn to pose questions about their value and reliability as historical evidence. By exposing students to the critical examination of “the uses of the past,” the course aims to teach them to appreciate the authoritative nature of historical interpretation and its practical application in contemporary social and political rhetoric. The study of pre-modern cultural and political history through the prism of nationalism theories explains many aspects of modern Belarusian, Russian, and Ukrainian societies, as well as political aspirations of their leaders. At the end of the course, students should develop understanding of the continuity and change in the history of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, their belief systems, and nationalistic ideologies, and will be able to speak and write about these issues with competence and confidence.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Russia's 20th-Century: History Through Literature,REES 2730,Seminar,In Class,1,"To study Russia’s twentieth-century history through its literature is to come face-to-face with a country for which works of fiction have often served, as the writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn put it, as “a second government.” Russia is a society that takes literature seriously—one in which the pen is assumed to have direct historical consequences. In this course, we will study how twentieth-century Russian literature actively participated in war, revolution, totalitarian dictatorship, and resistance. The masterworks we will study open windows into worlds of revolutionary rapture and moral uplift in the face of tyranny, of history as a gigantic wheel that lifts some people up even as it crushes others.

"Portraits of Old Russia: Myth, Icon, Chronicle",REES 6100,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course covers eight centuries of Russia’s cultural, political, and social history, from its origins through the eighteenth century, a period which laid the foundation for the Russian Empire. Each unit is organized around a set of texts (visual, literary, historical, cinematic, musical) which examine prominent historical and legendary figures as they represent chapters in Russia’s history. Historical figures under examination include, among others, the Baptizer of Rus, Prince Vladimir; the nation-builder, Prince Alexander Nevsky; the first Russian Tsar, Ivan the Terrible; the first Emperor and Westernizer, Peter the Great; the renowned icon painter Andrei Rublev; the epic hero, “bogatyr” Ilya Muromets; and the founder of Muscovite monasticism, St. Sergius of Radonezh. Three modern-day nation-states – Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus – share and dispute the cultural heritage of Old Rus, and their political relationships even today revolve around interpretations of the past and myths of ethnic descent. Has the Rus state been established by the Vikings or by the local Slavs? Is Russian political despotism an inheritance from the Mongols or a native ideology? Is Kievan Rus a mother state of Russia or Ukraine? The constructed past has a continuing influence in modern Russia, and is keenly referenced, sometimes manipulatively, in contemporary social and political discourse. Recently, for example, President Putin has justified the annexation of Crimea to Russia by referring to it as the holy site of Prince Vladimir’s baptism, from which Russian Christianity ostensibly originates. The study of pre-modern cultural and political history through the prism of nationalism theories explains many aspects of modern Russian society, as well as many political aspirations of its leaders.

The Quest for a Universal Language,REES 6177,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar is an exploration in European intellectual history. It traces the historical trajectory, from antiquity to the present day, of the idea that there once was, and again could be, a universal and perfect language among humanity. The tantalizing question of the possibility of such a language has been a vital and thought-provoking inquiry throughout human history. If recovered or invented, such a language has the potential to explain the origins, physical reality, and meaning of human experience, fostering universal understanding and world peace. Greek philosophers grappled with the capacity of names to correctly denote things. In Judaic and Christian traditions, the notion that the language spoken by Adam and Eve perfectly expressed the nature of the physical and metaphysical world captivated the minds of intellectuals for nearly two millennia. In defiance of the biblical myth of the confusion of languages and peoples at the Tower of Babel, they persistently endeavored to overcome divine punishment and rediscover the path to harmonious life. In the 19th century, Indo-Europeanist philologists perceived an avenue to explore the early stages of human development by reconstructing a proto-language. In the 20th century, romantic idealists like the inventor of Esperanto, Ludwik Zamenhof, constructed languages to further understanding among estranged nations. For writers and poets of all times, from Cyrano de Bergerac to Velimir Khlebnikov, the concept of a universal and perfect language has served as an inexhaustible source of inspiration. Today, this idea reverberates in theories of universal and generative grammars, in the approach to English as a global language, and in various attempts to devise artificial languages, including those intended for cosmic communication. Each week, we examine a particular period and a set of theories to explore universal language projects. But above all, at the core of the course lies an examination of what language is and how it is used in human society.",Not available,Not available,Not available,W 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),Julia Verkholantsev,,,,,"COML 6177,ENGL 7177",,,[1.0]

"Gender, Sexuality, and Religion",RELS 0050,Lecture,In Class,1,"What does it mean to be a gendered individual in a Muslim, Hindu, Jewish, Christian, or Buddhist religious tradition? How important are gender differences in deciding social roles, ritual activities, and spiritual vocations? This course tackles these questions, showing how gender - how it is taught, performed, and regulated - is central to understanding religion. In this course we will learn about gendered rituals, social roles, and mythologies in a range of religious traditions. We will also look at the central significance of gender to the field of religious studies generally. Part of the course will be focused on building a foundation of knowledge about a range of religious traditions and the role of gender in those traditions. This course focuses on religious traditions with origins outside the West. Although it is beyond the scope of this class to offer comprehensive discussions of any one religious tradition, the aim is to provide entry points into the study of religious traditions through the lens of gender. This course will train you in historical, anthropological, and theoretical methodologies. We will also read religion through feminist and queer lenses - we will explore the key characteristics of diverse feminist and queer studies approaches to religion, as well as limits of those approaches.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

Themes of spiritual formation and religious belonging as a process—healing, self-making, writing, growing up, renouncing, dreaming, and liberating—characterize the religious journeys of the African American writers, thinkers, and leaders whose works we will examine.

We will begin with the two most famous Daoist works--the Zhuangzi and the Daodejing (or Laozi). We will also survey other bio-spiritual practices, such as the meditational techniques of Inner Alchemy and the self-cultivation regimens known today as Qigong and Tai-chi, as well as the theological and ritual foundations of organized Daoist lineages, many of which are still alive across East Asia. We will conclude with a critical review of the twentieth-century reinvention of ""Daoism,"" the scientization of Inner Alchemy, and the new classification of ""religious"" versus ""philosophical Daoism."" While familiarizing ourselves with the key concepts, practices, and organizations developed in the history of Daoism, this course emphasizes the specific socio-political context of each of them.

Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as ""Just-War,"" Women's Rights and Abortion. While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara, Japan or Vietnam, Laos.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

To capture the rich diversity in Christian experience and expression, we will turn to the material practices of religion and explore how things, places, and bodily acts shaped what it meant to be Christian. Building on insights drawn from archaeology, art history, anthropology, and religious studies, we will seek to recover the experiences of diverse and often marginalized subjects and communities, and in the process, will problematize the categories of religion, authority, and identity.

History of Islam in Asia,RELS 5860,Seminar,In Class,1,"This class is designed to structure reflection on Islam and Islamic culture in South Asia-- Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Contrary to the popular perception that the Middle East defines Islam, Asian countries not only host the most Muslims in the world but have been the source of some of Islam's most important social and reform movements in the last three hundred years. This class looks at the history of Muslim societies across Asia not just as a religious community but also as a social and cultural bloc (a distinctive part of what Marshall Hodgson called the 'Islamicate' world, but also an area that challenges some of Hodgson's assumptions about the Islamicate world). This course allows for the study of the Muslim world between the years1700 to present. The class will allow students to compare and contrast Muslim societies over the last three centuries, examine points of confluence for geographically- or culturally- distinct Muslim peoples in the last three centuries, and in their writing assignments focus on the history of one society in a wider Islamicate context.

Worlds of Late Antiquity,RELS 6080,Seminar,In Class,1,"The period between the third and eighth centuries - from the Tetrarchy led by Diocletian to the rise of Umayyad Caliphate - is characteristically regarded as a period of ferment and change, whether that be on the still-influential model of Decline and Fall first proposed by Edward Gibbon in the eighteenth century or the somewhat less deterministic account of transformation favored by Peter Brown in the late twentieth. These narratives tend to emphasize the large-scale processes that played out over these centuries, such as the florescence and fragmentation of two world empires; the emergence of two highly influential monotheistic religions of the book; and the codification of legal systems that continue to dominate contemporary practices and theories of law. Equally, what characterizes these centuries is the particular granularity and character of the textual and archaeological evidence that exists for the functioning of this world at the micro-scale, as against the periods that preceded and followed. This course traces the social, economic, cultural, and religious institutions and processes that make this period distinctive, explores the nature of the evidence for those institutions and processes, and exposes to scrutiny the assumptions and preconceptions that underpin the scholarly narratives that have been constructed about them.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Graduate/Research level students.,Not available,T 1:45pm-4:44pm (8/27 to 12/9),"Kimberly Bowes

Hop aboard the Indian Ocean dhows, Chinese junks, Dutch schooners, and British and American clipper ships that made possible the rise of global capitalism, new colonial relationships, and the intensified forms of cultural change. How have the desires to possess and consume particular commodities shaped cultures and the course of modern history? This class introduces students to the cultural history of the modern world through an interdisciplinary analysis of connections between East and West, South and North. Following the circulation of commodities and the development of modern capitalism, the course examines the impact of global exchange on interactions and relationships between regions, nations, cultures, and peoples and the influences on cultural practices and meanings. The role of slavery and labor migrations, colonial and imperial relations, and struggles for economic and political independence are also considered. From the role of spices in the formation of European joint stock companies circa 1600 to the contemporary cocaine trade, the course's use of both original primary sources and secondary readings written by historians and anthropologists will enable particular attention to the ways that global trade has impacted social, cultural, and political formations and practices throughout the world.",Not available,Not available,"ANTH Cultural and Linguistics (AACL)

See the English Department's website at www.english.upenn.edu for a description of the current offerings.,"This course will examine the ways in which imaginative literature and film have addressed the difficult socio-political issues leading up to, and following from, the independence and partition of British India. Pakistan and India came into being as nation-states in moments of great national trauma: historians have long argued over the process that led up to Partition, and we will study some of these debates, but for the most part we will examine novels, short stories, poetry, and some films to think about the impact of Partition and Independence on communities and individuals in South Asia. In doing so, we will recognize the continuing role of these events and experiences in shaping the cultural, social, and political realities of contemporary South Asia (including the creation of Bangladesh in 1972). We will also learn about the crucial role played by literary and creative texts in making available to us the full dimensions of human tragedy, especially those precipitated when the imperatives of nation-formation redefine the lives of individuals or of sub-national communities.",Not available,"Ben Franklin Seminars (UNBF)

Narrative Across Cultures,SAST 1124,Lecture,In Class,1,"The purpose of this course is to present a variety of narrative genres and to discuss and illustrate the modes whereby they can be analyzed. We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.","How does literature both connect cultures across time and space and speak about what is specific to each culture? In this course we will read several types of stories written in different periods and in different parts of the world, ranging from classical Greek and Sanskrit drama to modern African, European, American and Asian novels. Many of these texts are very well known, have had long afterlives, and have been adapted and rewritten in distant spaces and times. In some cases, we will engage with these retellings. Others directly embody the coming together or friction between cultures and peoples. By studying them, we can reflect on how literary texts reflect the cultures in which they were produced and have a capacity to travel across cultures.",Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

"Economic Histories of Modern South Asia, c. 1600 - Present",SAST 1560,Lecture,In Class,1,"Courses on the economic history of South Asia typically begin circa 1750, when European Company produced data series legible to economic historians first become available. This course departs from that trend, by beginning with the expansion of the Mughal empire and its deeply bureaucratized revenue system, along with the arrival of the British and Dutch East India Companies in the early seventeenth century. The course ends not in 1947 (with the decolonization of the subcontinent), but rather with the liberalization of independent national economies in the late twentieth century, which significantly altered the commercial landscape by permitting the entrance of foreign direct investment. We will analyze numerous economic and socio-political phenomena that played into commercial development and change across the subcontinent during this period, including: the organization and influence of colonial joint-stock companies; systems of land tenure; the role of ecology in affecting economic production and consumption; industrial growth and the rise of economic urbanism; labor organization and the significance of kinship and patronage; and the immense influence of the informal (i.e. “shadow” or “black”) economy, comprising some three-fourths of the South Asian labor force. The course will also introduce students to some of the theoretical literature in economic history scholarship.

Introduction to Buddhism,SAST 1730,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course seeks to introduce students to the diversity of doctrines held and practices performed by Buddhists in Asia. By focusing on how specific beliefs and practices are tied to particular locations and particular times, we will be able to explore in detail the religious institutions, artistic, architectural, and musical traditions, textual production and legal and doctrinal developments of Buddhism over time and within its socio-historical context. Religion is never divorced from its place and its time. Furthermore, by geographically and historically grounding the study of these religions we will be able to examine how their individual ethic, cosmological and soteriological systems effect local history, economics, politics, and material culture. We will concentrate first on the person of the Buddha, his many biographies and how he has been followed and worshipped in a variety of ways from Lhasa, Tibet to Phrae, Thailand. From there we touch on the foundational teachings of the Buddha with an eye to how they have evolved and transformed over time. Finally, we focus on the practice of Buddhist ritual, magic and ethics in monasteries and among aly communities in Asia and even in the West. This section will confront the way Buddhists have thought of issues such as ""Just-War,"" Women's Rights and Abortion. While no one quarter course could provide a detailed presentation of the beliefs and practices of Buddhism, my hope is that we will be able to look closely at certain aspects of these religions by focusing on how they are practiced in places like Nara, Japan or Vietnam, Laos.",Not available,Not available,"College FND Cross Cultural Analysis (AUCC)

The Making of Medieval India,SAST 2262,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will provide an in-depth understanding of South Asia in what is often called its 'medieval' period--from the rise of the great temple kingdoms until the end of the Delhi Sultanate in the sixteenth century (c. 500 CE - c. 1500 CE). This millenium is arguably one of the most transformative in South Asia's history, a period when many of its most distinctive social and cultural features evolved. The course will provide both an overview of the period as well as an introduction to major interpretations and types of sources (textual, visual, and archaeological). The focus throughout the course will be on the heterogeneous development of states, societies and cultures with special attention to long-term processes of transformation. One set of themes explored will be largely social and economic, focusing on the development of agrarian and peasant societies, aristocracies and intellectuals, as well as the role of mercantile, pastoralist, nomadic and forest-living groups. Another set of themes will explore cultural transformation, including the development, transformation and interaction of religious practices, the emergence of cosmopolitan and regional literary cultures, and the rise of distinctive urban, courtly, and rural world views.

Religion and Resistance in South Asia,SAST 2554,Seminar,In Class,1,"In this course, we focus on various medieval and contemporary devotional forms of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam in South Asia. Several definitions try to tie the idea of devotion to classicism and traditionalism with a set of conservative ideas. However, this course introduces the students to a diverse and pluralistic understanding of Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam that also has a history of resistance and protest beginning with poets such as Kabir and others from the Bhakti movement, and Sufi devotional contexts in South Asia. We read about the histories of these rebellious poets and their interventions into the traditional practices of devotion. We also discuss about how these medieval trends find their way into contemporary times enriching the discourses of Dalit, Muslim and Feminist movements.",Not available,Not available,"INTR International Relations Elective (AIRE)

History of Islam in Asia,SAST 5860,Seminar,In Class,1,"This class is designed to structure reflection on Islam and Islamic culture in South Asia-- Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Contrary to the popular perception that the Middle East defines Islam, Asian countries not only host the most Muslims in the world but have been the source of some of Islam's most important social and reform movements in the last three hundred years. This class looks at the history of Muslim societies across Asia not just as a religious community but also as a social and cultural bloc (a distinctive part of what Marshall Hodgson called the 'Islamicate' world, but also an area that challenges some of Hodgson's assumptions about the Islamicate world). This course allows for the study of the Muslim world between the years1700 to present. The class will allow students to compare and contrast Muslim societies over the last three centuries, examine points of confluence for geographically- or culturally- distinct Muslim peoples in the last three centuries, and in their writing assignments focus on the history of one society in a wider Islamicate context. In the process students will gain a more nuanced awareness of how Islam has made an impact in Asian countries, and how Asian countries have in turn impacted Islam.",Not available,Undergraduate level students may not enroll.,"Hunstman International Studies (UNIS)

The Making of Medieval India,SAST 6262,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will provide an in-depth understanding of South Asia in what is often called its 'medieval' period--from the rise of the great temple kingdoms until the end of the Delhi Sultanate in the sixteenth century (c. 500 CE - c. 1500 CE). This millenium is arguably one of the most transformative in South Asia's history, a period when many of its most distinctive social and cultural features evolved. The course will provide both an overview of the period as well as an introduction to major interpretations and types of sources (textual, visual, and archaeological). The focus throughout the course will be on the heterogeneous development of states, societies and cultures with special attention to long-term processes of transformation. One set of themes explored will be largely social and economic, focusing on the development of agrarian and peasant societies, aristocracies and intellectuals, as well as the role of mercantile, pastoralist, nomadic and forest-living groups. Another set of themes will explore cultural transformation, including the development, transformation and interaction of religious practices, the emergence of cosmopolitan and regional literary cultures, and the rise of distinctive urban, courtly, and rural world views. Special themes of discussion may include violence and manners, material cultures, religious conflict, devotional religion and gender relations.",Not available,Not available,SEAS Humanities (EUHS),M 5:15pm-8:14pm (8/27 to 12/9),Daud Ali,3.5,3.7,3.1,2.9,,SAST 2262,,[1.0]
"Performance, Politics, and Power in Modern India",SAST 6612,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar locates performance in modern India – understood here as music, theatre, and dance – in the context of its social production and the production of its value. On the one hand, the course builds on perspectives drawn from Marx, Bourdieu, and others, and on the other, it examines themes of social hierarchy, taste habits, labor and corporeal exertion, and caste to think about the braiding of the arts and politics in modern India. A primary objective of the course is to de-center earlier nationalist-inflected histories about the arts in modern India, and bridge new thinking on performance across diverse forms of knowledge and critical methods. The seminar revolves around a number of significant questions for the study of culture in modern India. How does the modern Indian nation-state mediate and mold taste-habits and hierarchies? How do we historicize the making of the hierarchy of so-called “classical” and “folk” performance in modern India? How can we think of the arts as commodities of exchange and vessels of capital in the context of the majoritarian state? To what extent do late nineteenth and early twentieth-century “reform” and projects of cultural reinvention undergird the contemporary practice of these arts, particularly in the age of the majoritarian Hindu state? How do Dalit-Bahujan and minority religious communities claim their pasts and engage in articulatory practices that stage new modes of identity and resistance?",Not available,Not available,Not available,W 10:15am-1:14pm (8/27 to 12/9),Davesh Soneji,,,,,,,,[1.0]

In order to introduce students to specific literary cultures (classical, regional, contemporary) and to the scholarly practices that situate literature in broader contexts of culture and society, the course will focus both on the literary theories - especially from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries - that position South Asia's literary cultures within broader disciplinary frameworks that use literary documents to inform social, historical and cultural research projects.

Pakistan and India came into being as nation-states in moments of great national trauma: historians have long argued over the process that led up to Partition, and we will study some of these debates, but for the most part we will examine novels, short stories, poetry, and some films to think about the impact of Partition and Independence on communities and individuals in South Asia. In doing so, we will recognize the continuing role played by these events and experiences in shaping the cultural, social, and political realities of contemporary South Asia. We will also learn about the crucial role played by literary and creative texts in making available to us the full dimensions of human tragedy, especially those precipitated when the imperatives of nation-formation redefine the lives of individuals or of sub-national communities.","Enrollment is limited to Graduate/Research level students.

This course provides an overview of how various social determinants of health—e.g., race, class, gender, culture, and environment—are connected to health disparities and shape access to healthcare. Specifically, we examine how an uneven distribution of resources and contested power dynamics among social groups lead to persistent inequalities in health outcomes in both the U.S. and global contexts. Additionally, we explore the professionalization of medicine, the industrialization of healthcare, as well as the forces that have led to “medicalization” in our society.

The Law in our Lives,SOCI 0004,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar will provide students with the opportunity to engage in a discussion of the rule of law and how to make sense of it in their daily lives in light of the various theoretical perspectives and doctrines of law. Frequently, law is viewed exclusively to be what lawyers and judges do and what law students study, but its enduring presence in our lives is often not thought about. The very building in which a student is taking a class is governed by legal codes. If a student stopped at the library to copy some research material, copyright laws are involved. If a student made a purchase prior to class, liability laws and contract laws are involved, and so forth. The interaction of the individual with the rule of law is not limited to domestic and national laws, it also extends to international law. In analyzing the individual’s interaction with the rule of law, this seminar will introduce students to the classical and contemporary perspectives of law and society.

Sociology of Gender,SOCI 1100,Lecture,In Class,1,"Gender is an organizing principle of society, shaping social structures, cultural understandings, processes of interaction, and identities in ways that have profound consequences. It affects every aspect of people's lives, from their intimate relationships to their participation in work, family, government, and other social institutions and their place in the stratification system. Yet gender is such a taken for granted basis for differences among people that it can be hard to see the underlying social structures and cultural forces that reinforce or weaken the social boundaries that define gender. Differences in behavior, power, and experience are often seen as the result of biological imperatives or of individual choice. A sociological view of gender, in contrast, emphasizes how gender is socially constructed and how structural constraints limit choice. This course examines how differences based on gender are created and sustained, with particular attention to how other important bases of personal identity and social inequality--race and class-interact with patterns of gender relations.

The Future of Work,SOCI 2260,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course draws on sociological and social scientific research and theorizing to conceptualize the complex and dynamic relationship between work and technology. Rather than viewing technology as an immutable force that sweeps across societies and leaves social change in its wake, we will examine how the design, implementation, and outcomes of technological change are imbricated in political, economic, and social forces. We will mostly, though not exclusively, focus on developments in and case studies of work and technology in the United States. We will begin by examining theoretical perspectives on the historical interplay between work and technology. Then, we will consider contemporary issues, building dialogues between our theoretical groundwork and empirical evidence to trace continuities and disjunctures. By the end of the course, you will be equipped to interrogate the role of technology in capitalism's past, understand its relation to our present age of digital disruption, and imagine the possibilities for our uncertain future.",Not available,Not available,"NU Sector Society&Soc Struct (NUSS)

The course begins by asking where social problems come from. The main sociological perspectives of Marx, Weber and Durkheim are developed in connection with the issues of inequality, social conflict and community. We then turn to the social construction of social problems by examining how various issues become defined as social problems. This involves a consideration of the role of the media, social experts and social movements. The last section of the course considers how social problems are addressed. Here we discuss the relative strengths and weaknesses of government programs and regulations versus market-based approached. We also discuss the role of philanthropy and volunteerism. Finally, we consider the risk of unanticipated consequences of reforms.

Globalization And Its Historical Significance,SOCI 2910,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course sets the current state of globalization in historical perspective. It applies the concepts of anthropology, history, political economy and sociology to the study of globalization. We focus on a series of questions not only about what is happening, but about the growing awareness of it and the consequences of this increasing awareness. In answering these questions we draw on a variety of case studies, from historical examples of early globalization (e.g. The Atlantic and Indian Ocean Worlds, global flows of conspicuous commodities such as sugar, coffee, and tea, the rise and transformations of early capitalism), to issues facing our current globalized world (e.g. mass-mediatization and multilingualism, border regimes and international migration, planetary urbanization). The body of the course deals with particular dimensions of globalization, reviewing both the early and recent history of each. The overall approach is historical and comparative, setting globalization on the larger stage of the economic, political and cultural development of various parts of the modern world. The course is taught by anthropologists who draw from economic, linguistic, sociocultural, archaeological, and historical perspectives, offering the opportunity to compare and contrast distinct disciplinary approaches.

Contemporary homelessness differs significantly from related conditions of destitute poverty during other eras of our nation's history. Advocates, researchers and policymakers have all played key roles in defining the current problem, measuring its prevalence, and designing interventions to reduce it. The first section of this course examines the definitional and measurement issues, and how they affect our understanding of the scale and composition of the problem. Explanations for homelessness have also been varied, and the second part of the course focuses on examining the merits of some of those explanations, and in particular, the role of the affordable housing crisis. The third section of the course focuses on the dynamics of homelessness, combining evidence from ethnographic studies of how people become homeless and experience homelessness, with quantitative research on the patterns of entry and exit from the condition. The final section of the course turns to the approaches taken by policymakers and advocates to address the problem, and considers the efficacy and quandaries associated with various policy strategies. The course concludes by contemplating the future of homelessness research and public policy.",Not available,"Enrollment limited to students with the Penn Classification Freshman attribute.

The Information Age,SOCI 2951,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"We are said to live in an “information age.” Information technologies have been credited with ushering in an era of unprecedented information creation, collection, storage, and communication. We experience the impact of this firsthand: these technologies increasingly pervade our homes, our workplaces, our schools, our most private spaces. But what exactly do we mean when we speak of the information age? When and how did it come into being? What developments—social, economic, political, or technological—made the digital world possible? How do these fit in the longer history of technology and society? And how is all this different from earlier eras? In this course, we explore these questions by looking to the history of information, information technologies, and information sciences, a history that long predates the digital computer. Although, at the center of our story will be the development of new information technologies—from the printing press and the telegraph to the computer and of course the Internet—our focus will not primarily be on machines, but on people and how individuals conceptualized, contributed to, made sense of, and dealt with the many transformational changes that have shaped the contours of our modern digital world. We will explore forms of identity, knowledge, and community that have emerged within this information age.

The course begins by exploring policy analysis frameworks, and the contexts of social policy and social policy research. The remainder of the course explores a variety of common approaches to the conduct of social policy research by looking at the types of questions social policy analysts most frequently ask, and the types of answers that they are most often able to provide. The policy analysis approaches we will examine include: needs assessment methodologies (e.g. the “epidemiology” of social problems); analyses of client-level service utilization patterns (e.g. creating “typologies”); modeling trends in demand for services over time (e.g. forecasting); locational and other spatial factors associated with need, service use, and resource allocation decisions (e.g. block grant formula funding); machine learning (e.g. predictive analytics); the roles of qualitative research methods in policy research; comparative research on social welfare policy; performance management applications of administrative data; and longitudinal, multisectoral research using integrated administrative data systems. The application of these various methods is illustrated with studies of mental health, homelessness, criminal justice, child welfare, housing and segregation, welfare reform, income inequality and social service planning.

Economics for Social Policy,SOCW 6680,Lecture,In Class,1,"Economics allows us to determine the costs and benefits of social policies like cash benefits, unemployment insurance, health insurance, pensions, education, etc. Policies typically affect the behavior of agents like individuals, families and firms, and we have to take these reactions into account when analyzing policy. Economics allows us to predict how policy is likely to affect behavior by understanding how the policy changes individuals' decisions, and what collective outcomes these myriad individual decisions bring about. For example, a universal basic income allows individuals to sustain themselves and their families when they are not working. At the same time, such guaranteed income has the potential to discourage people from looking for a job. If enough people are discouraged from looking for a job, employment in the economy will decrease, leading to lower production and lower tax revenues for the government. Policy makers have to take these phenomena into account in order to design a good income support system.",Varies by section,Varies by section,Not available,Varies by section,Varies by section,,,,,,,,[1.0]

Applied Linear Modeling - Lab,SOCW 8970,Laboratory,In Class,0,"This course deals with how to critically and responsibly model real-world data to answer social science, education, and social policy-related questions, using the framework of the general linear model. Linear modeling (which, in statistics, is synonymous with regression analysis) is the workhorse of much of quantitative social science and, despite its enormous flaws and powerful limitations (which this course will also cover!), it remains an important tool to understand and be able to use.

Mathematical (e.g., Gauss-Markov) assumptions are covered but the emphasis is on deeper epistemic assumptions and more immediate practical limitations. While not covered in detail, pointers will be given to techniques for specific types of data (especially multilevel modeling for nested data) and to important modern developments (especially structural causal modeling, non-parametrics, and machine learning).

Ways of Reading,SPAN 1900,Seminar,In Class,1,"Although it’s possible to read a short story or a novel on your own, approaching a text using theoretical tools produces a more insightful reading and leads the reader to a deeper appreciation of the text. In this course we shall read and discuss varied and stimulating literary works written by both canonical and non-canonical Hispanic authors, while you familiarize yourself with important theoretical and critical terms, notions, and debates. (Post)structuralist theorists offer an indispensable gateway to popular genres such as fantastic literature and science fiction; Ecocriticism will focus our attention on the portrayal of nature, shedding light on our contemporary environmental concerns; Marxist notions of class struggle provide useful tools when examining the conflicts between social groups presented in a text; a feminist or queer approach inform a literary work by foregrounding gender or sexual differences; and a psychoanalytical view may shed light on stories portraying family dynamics or a child’s behavior.

As linguistic historians, we shall follow a canonical chronology that will examine pre-Roman influences, the spread of Latin, the linguistic fragmentation of the Peninsula, medieval attempts at standardization, trans-Atlantic expansion, the rise of the Academía, and the linguistic revival of the Autonomías. (2) The internal history of the Spanish language: Just when did Latin become Spanish? Why are some linguistic changes predictable while others aren't? Why don’t Spanish speakers say ""fiestivo"" or ""duermimos""? But what about ""cuentista""? Why do some Spanish speakers say ""hablastes"", ""siéntensen"" and ""la di el libro a María""?

Beyond serving as illustrations in literary, ethnographic, and journalistic texts, photographs have long inspired authors. Some write about photographers or depict scenes of photography. Others collaborate with photographers or pick up the camera themselves, practicing photography in conjunction with (or as a separate, parallel endeavor to) their writing. Others still set out to imitate photography’s descriptive capacity in their prose or to reveal aspects of reality that the camera cannot hope to capture. As we read such literary texts closely, alongside photographs and critical essays on photography, we will ask: What kinds of storytelling do literature and photography make possible, separately and together?

Advanced Causal Inference,STAT 9220,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will provide an in depth investigation of statistical methods for drawing causal inferences from complex observational studies and imperfect randomized experiments. Formalization will be given for key concepts at the foundation of causal inference, including: confounding, comparability, positivity, interference, intermediate variables, total effects, controlled direct effects, natural direct and indirect effects for mediation analysis, generalizability, transportability, selection bias, etc.... These concepts will be formally defined within the context of a counterfactual causal model. Methods for estimating total causal effects in the context of both point and time-varying exposure will be discussed, including regression-based methods, propensity score techniques and instrumental variable techniques for continuous, discrete, binary and time to event outcomes. Mediation analysis will be discussed from a counterfactual perspective. Causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and associated nonparametric structural equations models (NPSEMs) will be used to formalize identification of causal effects for static and dynamic longitudinal treatment regimes under unconfoundedness and unmeasured confounding settings. This formalization will be used to define, identify and make inferences about the joint effects of time-varying exposures in the presence of (possibly hidden) time-dependent covariates that are simultaneously confounders and intermediate variables. These methods include g-estimation of structural nested models, inverse probability weighted estimators of marginal structural models, and g-computation algorithm estimators. Credible quasi-experimental causal inference methods will be described, leveraging auxiliary variables such as instrumental variables, negative control variables, or more broadly confounding proxy variables. Quasi-experimental methods discussed will include the control outcome calibration approach, proximal causal inference, difference-in-differences and related generalizations of these methods.

Why Medical Interventions Work or Fail: A Search for Answers,STSC 0343,Seminar,In Class,1,"The past is littered with interventions that worked or were thought to work that we hold in little regard today – from frontal lobotomies to bone marrow transplants for metastatic breast cancer. Since 1962 the FDA requires proof of efficacy for new drugs. Yet uncertainty surrounds the efficacy and safety of many drugs, technologies, and practices in use today. Will some future observer of today’s practices wonder, as we do about the bleeding and purging of traditional medicine, why we do the things we do? This course will go deep into the social history of modern Western biomedicine to make sense of the ideological, economic, technical, scientific, and social forces shaping the modern medical interventions and the work they do. Students will be introduced to the rewards and challenges of studying medicine as a social and historical process. Case studies of the efficacy of contemporary biomedical interventions will be enriched by in-class meetings with prominent social scientists, biomedical researchers, and clinicians, as well as some potential visits to clinics and historical sites. Each student will develop a research project or essay review related to the efficacy of medical interventions. Most students will likely explore a current or historical controversy over the efficacy and safety of a particular intervention. In addition, there will be two shorter writing assignments.",Not available,"Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.

Comparative Medicine,STSC 0490,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"This course explores the medical consequences of the interaction between Europe and the ""non- West."" It focuses on three parts of the world Europeans colonized: Africa, South Asia, and Latin America. Today's healing practices in these regions grew out of the interaction between the medical traditions of the colonized and those of the European colonizers. We therefore explore the nature of the interactions. What was the history of therapeutic practices that originated in Africa or South Asia? How did European medical practices change in the colonies? What were the effects of colonial racial and gender hierarchies on medical practice? How did practitioners of ""non-Western"" medicine carve out places for themselves? How did they redefine ancient traditions? How did patients find their way among multiple therapeutic traditions? How does biomedicine take a different shape when it is practiced under conditions of poverty, or of inequalities in power? How do today's medical problems grow out of this history? This is a fascinating history of race and gender, of pathogens and conquerors, of science and the body. It tells about the historical and regional roots of today's problems in international medicine.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"ANTH Medical Anthropology and Global Health (AAMA)

The Information Age,STSC 1600,Varies by section,In Class,Varies by section,"We are said to live in an “information age.” Information technologies have been credited with ushering in an era of unprecedented information creation, collection, storage, and communication. We experience the impact of this firsthand: these technologies increasingly pervade our homes, our workplaces, our schools, our most private spaces. But what exactly do we mean when we speak of the information age? When and how did it come into being? What developments—social, economic, political, or technological—made the digital world possible? How do these fit in the longer history of technology and society? And how is all this different from earlier eras? In this course, we explore these questions by looking to the history of information, information technologies, and information sciences, a history that long predates the digital computer. Although, at the center of our story will be the development of new information technologies—from the printing press and the telegraph to the computer and of course the Internet—our focus will not primarily be on machines, but on people and how individuals conceptualized, contributed to, made sense of, and dealt with the many transformational changes that have shaped the contours of our modern digital world. We will explore forms of identity, knowledge, and community that have emerged within this information age.

Trauma and Healing in Historical Perspective,STSC 2227,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course considers the diverse range of theories and topics related to trauma in the 20th and 21st centuries, looking to understand how trauma has been mobilized at different moments in history for political, social, and personal ends. The point of the course is not to simply support or deny trauma as an interpretive framework for human pain and suffering, but instead to look critically at how it emerged as an object of study for medical and scientific circles and the benefits and ramifications of those biomedical frameworks that were felt at the time and stay with us into the present. We also consider how trauma has been taken up by actors outside of medicine and science, including popular media, fiction and activist communities. Using frameworks from feminist science studies, disability studies, black studies and queer studies, alongside more traditional histories of psychiatry, medicine and technology, students think about such diverse topics as sexual violence, racial violence, domestic and familial abuse, theories of psychological development, memory and trust, citizenship, the criminal justice system, the effects of our environments, intergenerational effects of violence, embodiment, biomedical models of risk and disease and narratives of the self. At the heart of this course is an interest in how we should understand humans’ capacity to harm and be harmed by one another, and how we can attend to the enduring effects of inequality and structural violence while remaining firmly grounded in the day-to-day lived, felt realities of violence and interpersonal harm.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"HSOC Major Related (AHSM)

In this course we explore the relationship between slavery and disease and its impact upon European, Native American, and African descended populations in the Americas during the era of early contact to the early nineteenth century. We pay special attention to slavery’s economic, environmental, and human costs, as we investigate the development of the medical profession and the acquisition of formal and informal medical knowledge in this epoch. Beyond that, we will investigate how perceptions of disease susceptibility and overall experiences with specific illnesses proceeded along raced and gendered lines.

Manufacturing Minds: From Babbage to ChatGPT,STSC 2421,Lecture,In Class,1,"When asked to tell its own history, ChatGPT answers literally, describing (vaguely of course) its own training data set. When pressed to describe the longer history of “technology like you,” it mentions early computer science, programs that played chess or solved math problems, before naming deep learning algorithms and big data as the key breakthroughs. This lineage is not untrue, but it ignores the wider context in which individuals and organizations have come to pursue this strange dream of crafting an intelligent object. As an uncannily lucid conversation partner who freely performs all manner of textual tasks, ChatGPT participates in a longstanding tension in the history of information technology between the goals of manufacturing minds and making mindless clerical workers. In this course we historicize that tension in three domains—calculation, knowledge work, and games—all of which directly inform our efforts to imagine what ChatGPT and its ilk might be. Throughout, we will attend to the ways machinery shaped specific tasks’ construction in relation to gender, race, and class identities. We will see how technologies often imagined as disembodied are always material, interacting with human bodies and physical environments.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"HSOC Disease and Culture (AHSD)

In the first unit, we’ll look at how institutions and technologies influence the modern life sciences, including the role of universities, public health departments, and museums in the development of biology. In the second unit, we’ll explore areas of biology that have raised controversies about regulation and access, including issues ranging from health to the environment.

Normal People,STSC 3028,Seminar,In Class,1,"For most of us, what’s normal feels downright natural. The normal is our baseline, invisible and unconsidered until something abnormal draws our attention to it. But a little prodding shows the contradictions within bland, boring normality: it’s defined by our internal feelings as much as by quantified standards, it describes individuals as well as populations, and it is intensely difficult to describe on its own merits without comparison. So what does it mean to be normal, anyway? This seminar examines “the normal” as a medical and scientific concept from the Renaissance until today. Has the concept of normal always existed? What makes a person or body normal? How has such a thing been assessed? Can the normal exist without deviance – and is this relationship inherently one about power? We will examine how scientific ideas of “the normal” – and its conflation with “the natural” – shaped medical knowledge and ideologies about racial difference, sex and gender, socioeconomic class, anatomical difference and disability, and human behavior. How have the “normals” of the past shaped our current scientific understandings of ourselves and the people around us? Our goal will be to make visible the ways that “normal” gets normalized in order to deepen our critical engagement with modern medicine, wellness culture, and racial and gender politics.",Not available,Enrollment is limited to Undergraduate level students.,"HSOC Disease and Culture (AHSD)

Technology and Medicine in Modern America,STSC 4427,Seminar,In Class,1,"Medicine as it exists in the United States today is profoundly technological. Many folks residing in the U.S. regard it as perfectly normal for clinicians to examine patients with instruments, for specialists to expose people’s bodies to many different machines, and for those machines to produce data that is mechanically/electronically processed, interpreted and stored. People are billed technologically, prompted to attend appointments technologically, and buy everyday consumer technologies to protect, diagnose, or improve our health. (Consider, for example, air-purifiers, heart rate monitors, pregnancy testing kits, blood-sugar monitoring tests, and thermometers.) Yet even at the beginning of the twentieth century, devices such as these were scarce and infrequently used by American physicians and medical consumers alike. Over the course of this semester, we examine how “technology” came to medicine’s center-stage in the U.S., and what impact this change has had on medical practice, institutions, and consumers alike. Technology & Medicine in Modern America fulfills the Capstone research requirement for the HSOC major. Students develop and execute original research projects connected to our course questions and themes. Student topics can be wildly diverse and reflect their own interests and concentration: reproductive technologies, technology & disability, pharma & biotech, public health tech, medicalized consumers/”everyday” med tech, technology & enhancement, med tech & the military, and so on. By the end of the course, students will have honed their skills in primary and secondary source research and in constructing an academic argument and paper. Assignments. Students formulate a research question; appropriately situate their question within the literature of a core STSC/HSOC discipline (anthropology, sociology, or history); and build an argument (an answer to their research question) based on their analysis of primary sources. In addition, students continue to develop skills in critical analysis through weekly reading assignments and discussions. Requirements therefore include: weekly readings and participation in class discussions; sequenced research assignments; first draft peer review workshop; and a final 20+page original research paper and presentation. Course Format. The course fosters a collaborative atmosphere in which students complete an original research paper through critical reading and step-wise assignments that culminate in a final project. Tuesdays & Thursdays 1:45-3:15pm EST = class discussion, about shared texts or about research or writing. Class time will occasionally be reserved for asynchronous time to work on research assignments. All readings and reading notes are due at 1:45pm in advance of our class sessions.

Mental Health Challenges in Childhood and Adolescence,SWRK 7730,Lecture,In Class,1,"This course will be an opportunity for the student and the instructor to explore the concept ""psychopathology"" as it has been and is applied to childhood and adolescence. There are some psychopathological challenges that are unique to childhood and some which can manifest themselves throughout childhood into adolescence and adulthood. The social worker/practitioner will encounter a wide range of symptomatic presentations among his/her clients. At this time in the fields of clinical social work, psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy there are numerous frameworks available to the practitioner to aid in an understanding of symptoms in children and adolescents. During the next several weeks three conceptual frameworks will be articulated. These three frameworks will elucidate the possible meaning, origin, and/or function of the symptoms and offer to the student a vocabulary with which to engage the situation. At the turn of the 19th century into the 20th century, psychoanalysis emerged in Europe as a method of understanding symptoms from the point of view of internal conflict within the child or adolescent. After World War II in the U.S.A., a model of understanding symptoms from a systemic/cybernetic point of view revolutionized the diagnostic processes involved in working with children and adolescents. Since the late 1980's, postmodern ideas, primarily from Europe and Australia, have greatly influenced and informed the understanding of psychopathology in children and adolescents. Narrative, social constructivist, and linguistic usage patterns have become a common vocabulary in the discourse on psychopathology. This course is not intended to be a reading of the history of child psychopathology. It is intended to expose the student to the most influential paradigms in the field of child psychopathology.",MSW Clinical Elective.,"Undergraduate level students may not enroll.

Each week, we will travel together across our city, encountering a wide array of plays, performances, and places, analyzing live theatre as both an art form and a cultural experience. These theatrical events will be examined in their entirety, as we consider: performance spaces; audiences; production elements such as directing, acting, and design; as well as the text of the plays themselves. Our readings will provide historical and theoretical contexts for our viewing; we will also examine the scripts of some of the plays we see, as well as critical commentary about them, and about theatre in Philadelphia.

Readings will be drawn from historical research, theoretical writings, plays and contemporary social documents. A particular focus will be on the integral role that the theatre plays as a cultural institution in the ongoing civic life of major cities.

They all compose repertoires of performance. From artistic performances in theatres, galleries, and concert halls to an individual’s comportment in everyday life, to sporting events, celebrations, courtroom proceedings, performance studies explores what happens when embodied activities are repeatable and given to be seen. In this course we ask: what is performance? How do we describe, analyze, and interpret it? What do theatre and everyday life have in common? How does performance legitimize or challenge the exercise of power? How has social media shifted our understanding of the relationship of our daily lives to performance? How does culture shape what is considered to be performance and how it functions? What isn’t performance? Throughout the semester students will apply key readings in performance theory to case studies drawn from global repertoires of contemporary and historical performance. In addition to analyzing artistic performances, we will also consider sporting events, celebrations, political events, and the performance of everyday life. We will attend to the challenges provoked by performance’s embodied, ephemeral, affective, effective, relational, and contingent aspects.

We will be looking at shorter types of narrative: short stories, novellas, and fables, and also some extracts from longer works such as autobiographies. While some works will come from the Anglo-American tradition, a larger number will be selected from European and non-Western cultural traditions and from earlier time-periods. The course will thus offer ample opportunity for the exploration of the translation of cultural values in a comparative perspective.","How does literature both connect cultures across time and space and speak about what is specific to each culture? In this course we will read several types of stories written in different periods and in different parts of the world, ranging from classical Greek and Sanskrit drama to modern African, European, American and Asian novels. Many of these texts are very well known, have had long afterlives, and have been adapted and rewritten in distant spaces and times. In some cases, we will engage with these retellings. Others directly embody the coming together or friction between cultures and peoples.

Movie Musicals: From Oz to La La Land,THAR 1276,Seminar,In Class,1,"The very first major sound film—The Jazz Singer, in 1927—featured not only speaking, but also singing. Audiences around the country hungrily consumed this new cinematic genre—one that was also strongly influenced by the stage musicals that were taking New York by storm. The synergy between Hollywood and Broadway was electric. Virtually every major composer and lyricist, including Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, and Rodgers and Hammerstein, worked both coasts. At the same time, the movies created new film celebrities, including Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne, Judy Garland, The Nicholas Brothers, and more. In the Depression 42nd Street, The Wizard of Oz, and Stormy Weather provided entertaining escapism—and sometimes a critical lens into reality. As time moved on movie musicals moved with them… and continue to do so. Jailhouse Rock, A Hard Day’s Night, Sparkle, The Who’s Tommy, Robert Altman’s Nashville, and Damien Chazelle’s La La Land are just a few of the films that reinvent and even subvert the genres, while showcasing stars from Elvis Presley to Tina Turner to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Movie Musicals will explore the development of this form and the artists who made it, including Busby Berkeley, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, Bob Fosse, Baz Luhrmann… and of course, Walt Disney.

August Wilson and Beyond,THAR 2325,Seminar,In Class,1,"""The people need to know the story. See how they fit into it. See what part they play.” - August Wilson, King Hedley II If you want to get to know community members from West Philadelphia, collaborate deeply with classmates, gain deeper and more nuanced understandings of African American history and culture, engage in a wide range of learning methods, and explore some of the most treasured plays in the American theatre, then this is the course for you. No previous experience required, just curiosity and willingness to engage. In this intergenerational seminar, Penn students together with older community members read groundbreaking playwright August Wilson's American Century Cycle: ten plays that form an iconic picture of African American traditions, traumas, and triumphs through the decades, nearly all told through the lens of Pittsburgh's Hill District neighborhood. (Two of Wilson’s plays are receiving fresh attention with recent acclaimed film versions: Fences with Denzel Washington and Viola Davis; Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom with Davis and Chadwick Boseman.) Class participants develop relationships with one other while exploring the history and culture that shaped these powerful plays. As an Academically Based Community Service (ABCS) course, the class plans and hosts events for a multigenerational, West Philadelphia-focused audience with community partners West Philadelphia Cultural Alliance / Paul Robeson House & Museum, and Theatre in the X. Class members come to a deeper understanding of Black life in Philadelphia through stories community members share in oral history interviews. These stories form the basis for an original performance the class creates, presented at an end-of-semester gathering. Wilson's plays provide the bridge between class members from various generations and backgrounds. The group embodies collaborative service through the art and connection-building conversations it offers to the community.",Not available,Not available,"AFRC African American Studies (AAFA)

Work on class can take the form of satire or solidarity; expose conflict and antagonism between and within a given class; historicize individual relationships within the history of property relations; focus on finances, wealth, or poverty; portray class ascent or descent.

Contemporary homelessness differs significantly from related conditions of destitute poverty during other eras of our nation's history. Advocates, researchers and policymakers have all played key roles in defining the current problem, measuring its prevalence, and designing interventions to reduce it. The first section of this course examines the definitional and measurement issues, and how they affect our understanding of the scale and composition of the problem. Explanations for homelessness have also been varied, and the second part of the course focuses on examining the merits of some of those explanations, and in particular, the role of the affordable housing crisis. The third section of the course focuses on the dynamics of homelessness, combining evidence from ethnographic studies of how people become homeless and experience homelessness, with quantitative research on the patterns of entry and exit from the condition. The final section of the course turns to the approaches taken by policymakers and advocates to address the problem, and considers the efficacy and quandaries associated with various policy strategies. The course concludes by contemplating the future of homelessness research and public policy.",Not available,"Enrollment limited to students with the Penn Classification Freshman attribute.

We will read the work of musicologists, cultural theorists, urban geographers, sociologists and educators who work to define urban space and the role of music and sound in urban environments, including through music education. While the readings make up our study of the sociology of urban space and the way we use music in everyday life to inform our conversations and the questions we ask, it is within the context of our personal experiences working with music programs in public neighborhood schools serving economically disadvantaged students, that we will begin to formulate our theories of the contested musical micro-cultures of West Philadelphia. This course is over two-semesters where students register for .5 cus each term (for a total of 1 cu over the entire academic year) and is tied to the Music and Social Change Residential Program in Fisher Hassenfeld College House which will sponsor field trips around the city and a final concert for youth to perform here at Penn, if possible.

Inequity and Empowerment: Urban Financial Literacy,URBS 1400,Seminar,In Class,1,"This course provides students with a rich look at the historical and contemporary factors that have shaped America's wealth gaps. By studying the economic impacts of systemic forces such as discriminatory housing, predatory lending, and unbanking, students will develop a deep financial understanding of today's urban communities. Students will also explore their own financial awareness and exposure, creating personalized financial histories and empowerment plans. By breaking the silence on topics such as credit scores, auto purchases, renting vs. owning a home, insurance, retirement plans, debt management, and investing, Urban Financial Literacy will prepare students for a financially healthy life at Penn and beyond. The course will also explore larger financial examples and case studies, including endowment funds and major foundations, the promises and perils of sports and entertainment, start-ups and the gig economy, and more. In contrasting the opportunity and excess that is possible, with the debilitating realities of intergenerational poverty in America, the idea is that students will end the course with a robust appreciation for financial literacy, a portfolio of practical strategies, and a commitment to create new possibilities for financial wellness.",Not available,Not available,"Academically Based Community Service Courses (UNAS)

Cities in Chinese History,URBS 2501,Seminar,In Class,1,"This seminar will study the development of Chinese cities over the past two millennia with respect to their spatial structure, social constitution, economic system, political functions, and cultural representation (including cityscape paintings, maps, and films).As China transitioned from a collection of city-states to a united empire to nation state, Chinese urbanism underwent transformations as drastic as those of the country itself. Cities, which serve as a critical mechanism for the operation of a vast agrarian empire/nation like China , offer a unique vantage point for us to observe and analyze the continuities and discontinuities between dynastic empires as well as the radical transition from empire to modern nation state. Topics include: the city-state system in ancient China; the creation and evolution of imperial capitals; the medieval urban revolution and the subsequent collapse of classic city plans; the development of urban public sphere/public space in late imperial China; the rise of commercial power in urban politics; the negotiation of urban class and gender relations via cultural consumption; the role of cities in the building of a modern Chinese nation state; the anti-city experiment under the communist regime; urban citizenship in the reform era; as well as the expanding urbanization and shifting urbanism of Greater China as reflected in cinematic representations of Shanghai, Hongkong, and Taipei.",Not available,Not available,"EALC Chinese and Inner Asia (AEAN)

Co-opted by marketing slogans, stripped of meaning and context, it has become vague and pliable. Sustainability and resilience demand a holistic systems view of the world. The course focuses on communities such as New Orleans and Eastwick where urban development has focused on economic concerns at the expense of the environment and equity resulting in unintended, and sometimes, catastrophic consequences.

The course focuses on justice-involved veterans who are at the nexus of two of the United States largest, most powerful, and well-funded institutions—the criminal justice system and the military. “Sweet is war to those who have never experienced it,” states the Latin proverb. Central to the curriculum is this very disconnect, between those who have experienced war and those who have not. In addition to communing with veterans, we will analyze popular depictions of war, veterans, violence, and prisons in order to assess how military members, justice-involved people, and survivors of violence are understood in the public imagination versus how they in fact understand themselves and their realities. Students will have in-person dialog with both official and lay experts, including clinicians, veterans, military members, chaplains, and incarcerated people.

How can citizens be engaged in the decision-making processes about the places where we live, work, and play? And most importantly, how can we work to make sure that all kinds of voices are meaningfully included, and that historically muted voices are elevated to help pave a better path forward?

Of great importance, the course will evaluate competing analytic trends in the social sciences and their respective implications in terms of the question of what can be known about urban poverty in the contexts of social policy and practice, academic research, and the broader social imaginary. We will critically analyze a wide body of literature that theorizes and explains urban poverty. Course readings span the disciplines of sociology, anthropology, urban studies, history, and social welfare.

"Considering Race, Class and Punishment in the American Prison System",URBS 9017,Seminar,In Class,1,"This writing seminar will sharpen and expand our writing, while bringing to our hearts and minds a deeper understanding of the reality of imprisonment in the United States. This system never goes away. This year it is locking up more than 2,300,000 men, women and children—the highest per-capita rate of imprisonment in the world. Even when we know the statistics and watch shows about crime and jail on TV, what do we really know about life behind bars? For a year? Ten years? Life? As a young journalist, I saw how the criminal justice system was used to suppress Black leadership. I felt drawn to teach creative writing at Holmesburg Prison, to eventually investigate the state prison system, interview prisoners, make friendships, write a newspaper series, magazine articles, and my first book on the subject. For nearly five decades, I’ve observed the human cost of a prison system that connects and damages all of our lives and keeps people from poverty in place. In this course, we will seek insights in books and stories written from prisoners’ personal experiences. We’ll also read scholars—Michelle Alexander, Bryan Stevenson, Angela Davis and others—who shed light on the historical repetitions and political exploitations. Guest speakers will include public defenders, parolees, former prisoners, and those fighting for prisoners’ rights and re-entry. Students will gain a more intimate understanding of how the legacies of slavery, racism, the prejudices of class, caste, and misogyny intersect and determine who goes to prison and who does not. Students will free-write for ten minutes a day, every day, and write personal reflections on readings, films, and guest speakers. Responses will lead to essays or stories that students write and present for class discussion. These key pieces may draw from observation, facts and imagination, and may traverse literary nonfiction, memoir, fiction, or poetry. We will present the best of your work in a reading at the end of the semester.",Not available,"Enrollment limited to students with a semester level of Graduate, Masters Candidate, Graduate, Post-Baccalaureate or Professional.","ENGL Creative Writing Workshop Course Minor (AECW)

Deepening income inequality. Stalemates over how to address global crises like climate change, human migration, and public health. The list is long. Tensions between politics and religion can exacerbate any of these divides. For some of us, this situation can feel overwhelming, making us apathetic or leaving us questioning whether any change is possible. Others of us end up looking for someone to blame or believing the worst of our fellow community members. How do we combat such feelings and build connections that make a difference? How do we build democratic power and mutual respect across difference? This class examines how local leaders and groups have worked to overcome such divides to bring change to their communities. By building partnerships between religious communities, citizen groups, labor unions and the like, people are making democracy work and bridging divides. Through class dialogue, writing projects, and students' own research, we will explore together how we can bridge divides in the many communities and groups we are a part of and how rhetorical and writing knowledge can play a role in it.","Students with a semester level of Junior or Senior may not enroll.

Posting about such practices on their Instagram and TikTok accounts gives consumers an opportunity to demonstrate social responsibility. Such crowdsourcing is increasingly playing a significant role in policing fashion intellectual property (IP). Unfortunately, social media users who participate in such policing do not themselves benefit as workers or consumers, although solicited influencers are sometimes compensated for such work. This writing seminar will commence its study of the topic by reading and analyzing Minh-Ha T. Pham's Why We Can't Have Nice Things: Social Media's Influence on Fashion, Ethics, and Property (Duke, 2022). We will consider the irony of how crowdsourced regulation of fashion creativity and copynorms often reproduces Western standards of fashion ethics, creativity, and IP, and can support racist exploitative norms. This writing seminar is transdisciplinary in nature and encourages students to research and engage with the topic in fields they find most interesting, for example, the arts, social media, psychology, legal studies, entrepreneurship and marketing.","Students with a semester level of Junior or Senior may not enroll.

These effects can be serious: ranging from emotional and behavioral changes, to speech, communication, and memory lapses. As we are better understanding the emotional, educational, and economic consequences of TBIs, caregivers, parents, policymakers, and patients are doing more to manage and care for those affected.

Throughout, students are introduced to new writing situations as a means of sharpening their skills and learning how to be adaptive, effective writers.","Global corporate consulting firms such as McKinsey, Deloitte, and Accenture are typically retained by client companies seeking to streamline business operations, maximize revenue, and keep ahead of industry competitors. The choicest of client accounts entail complex, long-term strategic and technological investments and operational know-how that yield billions of dollars in annual revenue for consultants. Yet do these firms act with their clients' best interests in mind? What is at stake for clients' reputations when consultants' recommendations are implemented, but fail, whether at the cost of profit, the environment, or even human lives? In this seminar, we will seek to answer these and related questions by engaging with Walt Bogdanich and Michael Forsythe's book When McKinsey Comes to Town: The Hidden Influence of the World's Most Powerful Consulting Firm. We will read case studies on McKinsey's work in the tobacco and opioid industries, with global oil companies, and as advisors to the governments of China, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia. Considering these will help us to critically think and write broadly about the business practices and ultimate accountability of some of the world's best-known companies.","Students with a semester level of Junior or Senior may not enroll.

By reading William I. Robinson's The Global Police State [2020], we will examine the means and methods by which governments have policed this surplus humanity through mass incarceration, state and public surveillance, state violence, increased police powers, the militarized administration of immigration and refugees, and the permanent mobilization for war. To what extent do these forms of repression and social control secure the rule of the global capitalist system? Do those who benefit the most from the staggering levels of wealth inequality require such violent means to secure their interests? To what extent does this global police state function as an engine of generating profits and accumulating capital in a period of stagnating economic growth and the seeming ineluctable obsolescence of many kinds of labor? Does this system of social control require a conscious ruling agent, or can it function in the interests of the few without their direct control? Students will engage these questions and the course topic through a variety of assignments that develop foundational writing and analytical skills applicable to academic, professional, and public writing situations.","Students with a semester level of Junior or Senior may not enroll.

Perhaps you are (or suspect you might be) someone whose brain works differently! Neurodiversity can refer to specific conditions like ADHD, autism, dyslexia, and so on, but it also refers to the whole range of neurological diversity in our species. Humans have always been neurodiverse, but we are only just now beginning to recognize and understand what that means for individuals and for us as a species. For some, to be neurodivergent - meaning, neurologically different from the norm - is a gift and an advantage. For others it's a disability. And for many, it's both. In this class, we'll learn more about what neurodiversity is and what it looks like, as well as the unique strengths it brings and the challenges that come with navigating a world that is not always built for people who think differently.","Students with a semester level of Junior or Senior may not enroll.
