         1. **Log In**: Go to Path@Penn and log in with your PennKey and password.
         2. **Discover & Research Courses**: Use the search functions to find courses. You can read course descriptions and view prerequisites.
         3. **Add Courses to Cart**: Select the desired courses and add them to your cart.
         4. **Request Courses**: During the Advance Registration period, submit your course requests. All requests are batch processed after the period ends, so timing within the period does not affect priority.
         5. **Confirm Registration**: After course requests are processed, confirm your schedule in Path@Penn. Make any necessary adjustments during the Course Selection period, also known as Add/Drop/Swap.
         For detailed steps and tips, refer to [Penn Student Registration & Financial Services](https://srfs.upenn.edu/registration) and the [College of Arts & Sciences](https://www.college.upenn.edu/registration) pages.
